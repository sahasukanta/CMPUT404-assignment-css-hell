    </div>

    <p class="center">(<i>For aren’t all prefaces really postscripts?</i>)</p>

    <p class="drop-cap">THIS chronicle of Gorgas and her friends was
        within sight of the end when out of Germany
        came the incredible news of war. Twenty-five
        years earlier Bardek had fought “the big
        Austrian” because “he had spoke against the French”;
        all of which the present scribe had duly writ down, but
        only as one tells of ancient passions or historic loves
        and hates. Who, outside of unspeakable Germany,
        was prepared for the shock of the world war? Then,
        when our own boys were moving across the seas—just
        because one had “spoke against the French”—the history
        of Gorgas and the Vinegar Saint was put aside,
        along with other matter that we once thought important;
        and the present historian was standing reveille,
        watch and guard on a scrubby hill leagues from home.
        Finally comes the collapse of the mad German dream,
        as abruptly as it began, and things of peace and sanity
        emerge, including this story of the Vinegar Saint.</p>

    <p>Well, good is good, and evil is evil; and there is to
        be no compromise nor confusion of the two. Such
        is the conclusion of the victory just accomplished—which
        is only what the Vinegar Saint had contended
        all along! It did not seem to need a world war to
        prove so true a truth.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">[ii]</span>The chronicler cannot resist giving Captain “Chuck”
        Williams’ account of a late meeting with Bardek.
        Slim and spruce he was; clean shaven—to prevent
        the white stubble from giving his years away; a major
        in the brilliant full dress of the French, one of that
        gay band, veterans all, who visited America during
        the early days of our entrance into the conflict. It
        was a leaden, characterless April day—a perfect
        “Deutschertag”—but he was spluttering French like
        a Roman candle. “Chuck” burst into the group,
        clicked heels and saluted profoundly. “Bardek!” he
        shouted, grasping his hands. “You old grandfather!
        What in the name of poetry are <i>you</i> doing in uniform!”
        The rogue! He was sixty years old if a day, but had
        got himself up like a youngster of thirty.</p>

    <p>He wrung “Chuck’s” hands with the old-time fervor,
        rattling a half-dozen medals on his breast, but his face
        remained a pantomime of inquiry, puzzledom and willingness
        to please any lunatic in the uniform of the
        U.S.A. Turning limply to a brother he begged a
        translation; then replied gravely, in French, “One is
        never too old to fight for France”; and added, “I am
        sorry that in my youth I did not pay attention to my
        teachers and thus learn to speak your beautiful English.
        Alas!”—a delectable shrug—“I know but
        French.”</p>

    <p>“You are Bardek—” “Chuck” began. “Bardek!”
        echoed the major. “You know me, then?”
        The shoulders lifted slightly. “Bardek, <i>c’est vraiment
            moi</i>! Bardek! <i>C’est ça! Commandant! Soixante-dixsept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">[iii]</span>
            régiment!!</i>” The shoulders went higher and
        prouder with each phrase, his whole suite following
        him in exact imitation. “<i>Tr-r-oisième bataillon!!!
            Chasseur a pied!!!!</i>” But the proud picture soon dissolved
        in swift laughter. “At the service of <i>m’sieu’
            le capitaine</i>,” he bowed. “<i>Le commandant</i> is complimented
        that <i>m’sieu’ le capitaine</i> should remember his
        acquaintance. We have perhaps met in France?”</p>

    <p>“It was in America, Bardek!” Captain Williams
        insisted. “Don’t try any of your infernal jokes on
        me. It was in Cresheim Valley! At Mount Airy!
        And what’s all this nonsense about not knowing English!”</p>

    <p>Bardek waited patiently for the interpreter to make
        the speech into French. “It was perhaps my grandfather,”
        he shrugged politely. “America I do not
        know. Always,” he touched his heart lightly, “always
        I have lived in France.” And from that he could not
        be budged.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, he ate the captain’s luncheon, he and
        his gay “devils”—“Chuck” was the envy of the
        whole restaurant—meanwhile telling him, in a French
        which was painfully slowed up for foreign ears, all
        the news of all the world. There were staccato, rapid-fire
        asides, to be sure, which drew roars from his companions;
        but he would not step out of the rôle of
        Frenchman. Many times he repeated, with varying
        grades of fervor, “Always I have lived in France!”</p>

    <p>At “Chuck’s” final handshake, however, he relented.
        “<i>Vive la France!</i>” said “Chuck,” gripping him hard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
        “<i>La Fr-r-rance!</i>” growled Bardek. They shook hands
        ferociously. Then the major leaned over—“Chuck”
        thought he was about to be kissed!—to whisper
        solemnly in his ear, “And you will give my loave to ol’
        Mack, if he be still alive, an’ to the Professor, and to
        the good Goargass, and you will tell her to be vair-r-y
        care-ful of herself. She is now too ol’ a woman to go
        splashing in rivers when it is yet April!”</p>

    <p>He left in a storm of basso laughter.</p>

            LEGS</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THE young man of twenty-three was not a
        clever tennis player, but his partner and his
        opponents, men of forty, were obviously less
        clever. The Mount Airy Club courts were sought
        chiefly by two sorts of players, boys too uncourageous
        for baseball, and men of impending girth; secluded by
        fine old ragged trees and off an unused road, it had no
        gallery of experts to disturb the timid.</p>

    <p>The young man belonged to neither class, but he
        found his Saturday afternoon game of tennis with perspiring
        business-men just the thing to put him in tone
        for his own week’s business of research among revered
        but defunct Elizabethans. Besides, he often had the
        joys of victory hard won.</p>

    <p>At present, he was fighting it out with a butter-and-egg
        middleman. Years of handling a fragile and perishable
        commodity had made the middleman self-conscious
        in the presence of so egg-like an object as a tennis
        ball. He puzzled his opponents, therefore, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
        inexperienced whist player so often does, by unaccountable
        delicacy when one naturally expected a smashing
        drive, and at other times by reckless lobbing—as if he
        had just condemned a bad shipment!—when the safe
        return was a gentle touch.</p>

    <p>A wife or two sat sewing in the lee of a cherry tree.
        They often stopped their mild chatter to watch some
        contested point—sometimes the ball stayed in play
        unaccountably long; a quarter of the returns was accidental!—at
        such times the repartee on the courts
        was equally compelling. A “professor” is by instinct
        talkative, and the enforced reticence of butter-and-egg
        middlemen unloosens sudden outbursts of speech—the
        figure has an unfortunate but truthful suggestion—like
        dammed things.</p>

    <p>All this was a generation ago—June 17, 1888, to be
        exact—a period when tennis in America was an exclusive
        sport like lacrosse or cricket. But the game had
        already made great headway toward being an American
        thing. Mount Airy players had long ago dug out the
        English “lawn” to make a “skin court”; they had
        twisted the English “thank you” into a technical and
        not always polite order to return stray balls, and had
        adopted the usual American system of “badgering.”
        Anyone could see that the young chap was trying to
        “talk” his opponent into error. In the American
        code, the man loses caste who cannot stand the steady
        grind of talk directed persistently at every weakness.</p>

    <p>An accidental shot to the middleman’s left hand, and
        an apt remark about left-handedness in general, had unnerved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
        the professor’s opponent for the moment, causing
        a deposit of several easy balls in the net. Further
        well-placed banter encouraged the irritated middleman
        to take out a little private revenge on the ball; result,
        a walloping “three-bagger” over toward the Mount
        Airy sky line.</p>

    <p>“Hard luck!” the young man murmured in mock
        politeness, gazing satirically after the ball, but the middleman
        seemed to view that terrific flight with deep satisfaction.
        His partner, however, scolded and advised
        him to be “steady.”</p>

    <p>The game stood “four all.” It was the middleman’s
        service. That looked like a sure win for the young
        professor’s side; that is, unless the middleman grew
        cautious and canny. Tennis is a game requiring great
        strength and equally great delicacy. The middleman
        had been brought up in the produce business. For ten
        years he had assisted, between two o’clock in the morning
        and sunrise, in the transportation of hundreds of
        cases of eggs, than which there are few occupations
        requiring more combined strength and delicacy.</p>

    <p>The middleman settled down to business. Balls were
        served with the wizard-like dexterity of a juggler.
        There was absolutely no “breakage”—a clean, fine
        shipment; score, 5-4.</p>

    <p>At the same time the professor suddenly slumped.</p>

    <p>He missed easy shots and fouled his partner. A
        young person sitting cross-legged on the side-lines—it
        was one of the many Levering girls, although one
        could not be sure without one’s glasses—had been for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
        some time deliberately making fun of him, and in a very
        stealthy fashion, too. His private and original twists
        of chin, arm, head, even the crinkling of the eyes to
        avoid the glare, these had been sedulously imitated.
        The professor put the left palm to his chin—a thoroughly
        characteristic attitude; the young lady, squatting
        like a tailor, put her left palm to her chin and
        wiggled the fingers in some subtle token of derision.
        The professor played with a twisted lock at the very
        crown of his head; the young lady elevated a gorgeous
        bunch of her own brown hair.</p>

    <p>This mirror-like mimicry got on his mind and caused
        some extraordinary tennis. Yes, she was one of the
        “Leverings”—a familiar name in that locality—but
        for a time he could not precisely place her. Ah!
        Those Leverings with the outlandish names, Regina?—Juanita?—</p>

    <p>“Hard luck!” grunted the middleman, with a sharp
        tinge of vengeance in his tone. The professor had
        served a monstrous “out.”</p>

    <p>What <i>was</i> the name? He cocked an eye aloft and
        sucked in both cheeks—an attitude of cogitation; the
        Levering young lady twisted her head and neck into a
        Pre-Raphaelite Pièta. He had danced with her many
        times. He had played tennis with her at—ah! Manheim!
        Manheim Levering! That was it. No!
        Manheim was the name of a street.... Some absurd
        family name. What was it? A bad return threw the
        game into deuce. He clapped his hand over his mouth
        as a sign of apology; the Levering person—first name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
        not yet recalled—immediately hid her face with a
        spread-out palm and peeped out between the fingers, a
        sign of utter shame over the bad play. Keyser! That
        was it! Keyser Levering. Of all the absurd names
        to give a girl! The Keysers had come over with Pastorius;
        that was enough to justify the maltreating of
        a young woman who—gracious!—she was pulling
        her nose, stroking it gently! Extraordinary conduct!
        Perhaps the name had affected her in some way.
        Names do react upon the owners; few Percys ever become
        valiant; Percy Hotspur was only a glorious exception.
        Pulling the nose was one of the young professor’s
        really bad habits; he had struggled all his life
        to stop it; the very thought of stopping gave him an
        uncontrollable itching. There! he was doing it again.
        And she? She was polishing vigorously with little
        finger upraised. The minx!</p>

    <p>The professor suddenly doubled-up and rubbed his
        belt. He had caught a stabbing blow “in the wind,”
        as they say in boxing.</p>

    <p>“Game and set!” exulted the middleman, and then
        offered satiric apologies for the knock-out; but the
        young man heard not; he was busy getting his breath
        and watching Miss Levering mimicking a gentleman
        doubled-up with a tennis ball in his stomach. A man
        may do some things, he thought as he pressed his lips
        and tried not to wince, that a lady should under no circumstances
        do. The young woman was certainly not
        herself that morning. Besides, he had borne the blow
        like a soldier, and had only passed a hand lightly over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
        the burning spot, while she—she was pantomiming like
        a child with the colic.</p>

    <p>His memory of her conduct on other occasions gave
        no hint of this. He recalled a quiet, lady-like person,
        mature, solicitous of the latest news of Elizabethan
        playwrights. The miss before him, sitting tailor-fashion
        on the grass, was carrying on—why, she was puckering
        her lips like a—but so was he!</p>

    <p>And now she was flirting with him, one eye deliberately
        closed, the other looking up mischievously.
        Could it be the heat?</p>

    <p>Finally he marched over and accused her of losing
        his game.</p>

    <p>“You sat there telling me all my faults in sign language,”
        he told her. “I got so interested I forgot how
        to play.”</p>

    <p>“Just when did you learn?” she inquired mildly.</p>

    <p>“Well!” he looked at her. Without doubt he was
        an erratic player, brilliant and simply bad alternately,
        the sort that never improves; but he had not the least
        ambition to do better, so the satire had no sting for
        him. “Well!” he retorted. “It wasn’t yesterday.”</p>

    <p>“No!” she speculated. “No! It couldn’t have
        been yesterday; it must have been this morning—after
        luncheon.”</p>

    <p>Her right hand made a vigorous swish through the
        air; her eyes followed an imaginary ball which obviously
        sailed high out of bounds; her left had come clap over
        the mouth in clear chagrin. In a flash the professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
        had himself dramatically presented at his worst, but
        her cheerful laughter saved the mimicry from anything
        but good-natured raillery.</p>

    <p>Then she told him how to hold his racket for certain
        plays, and instructed him in the theory of the angles
        of incidence and refraction upon which both tennis and
        billiards are founded.</p>

    <p>“Yes!” he would say, and “Really, now!”; or
        “Why, we learned all that in physics, but I never saw
        any use for it!” But his main interest was in watching
        the bright, eager face, the frank, brown eyes which
        looked straight into him steadily and explored him; and
        without the slightest gleam of—well, there is no word
        for it—the sort of mature awareness that is rarely
        absent when a woman looks steadily into the eyes of a
        man. There was health in her face and a dominant
        egoism like a man’s. The last time he had talked with
        her she had been timid, and clinging, and feminine; a
        thing that had frightened him off. He remembered
        that he had likened her to a young aunt—visited rarely—who
        used to throw her arms about him without
        notice and kiss him back of the ear. After much practice
        he had learned finally to sense the beginning of the
        aunt’s attack and so, in a measure, defend himself. A
        pathetic lookup of the eyes, dog-like and reverent, was
        the unfailing sign; just so, at their last meeting, this
        Levering lady had regarded him as they walked together.
        Unconsciously he had kept one arm ready
        to ward off a possible pounce.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Miss Levering had not the shadow of a pounce about
        her now. She was talking tennis like a sporting editor.
        Somehow, the professor felt sorry. His strongest wish
        at that moment was to be attacked.</p>

    <p>And he wasn’t listening at all to her harangue.</p>

    <p>“You must watch the other fellow’s swing. If he
        ‘cuts’ up you mustn’t ‘cut’ down. The ball is turning
        round and round, this way,” she illustrated by
        swinging circles. “If you spin it the way it’s going
        it will drop dead.”</p>

    <p>The professor was watching her animated face with
        the most open delight; and he followed her minute instructions
        absolutely not at all. Simple admiration
        beamed from him.</p>

    <p>“My dear young lady! My dear young lady!” he
        was saying over and over to himself. “I will never
        call you ‘Keyser.’ It is the name of an emperor and a
        dog, but not of a bit of humanity like your delightful
        self. Wonder of wonders! Cosmos and chaos! Who
        can understand, O Lord, thy marvelous doings....
        Male and female created He them.... Eyes, smiles,
        voice, gestures inimitable; soul, being, essence—what
        are they?... I don’t know anything.... Saw her
        for hours at a time and never noticed her till now....
        Could we live on $600 salary and the rent of six small
        dwellings, not always rented, and the income of the D.
        &amp; W. R. R., if it ever pays dividends? Glory be to
        Peter, what are eyes made of? And flesh and blood?
        Marvelous!... The Lord have mercy upon us and
        incline our hearts to keep Thy law!... Talk on!...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
        I’m not listening! It’s great! Oh, what a wonderful—”</p>

    <p>Then he spoke aloud, ejaculating as if he had been
        stung by a green fly.</p>

    <p>“Great Jupiter!” he shouted, and “Bless my
        soul!”</p>

    <p>She had stood to show him how to swing his racket
        for a “Lawford,” in those days a rare stroke among
        amateurs.</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul!” he exclaimed, staring at her feet.</p>

    <p>The young lady’s dresses stopped at her knees! As
        she swung about, a long braid of hair became visible
        for the first time, tipped with a dainty bow of crimson
        ribbon.</p>

    <p>“Say!” he clutched her by the arm. “How old are
        you?”</p>

    <p>“Thirteen,” she replied, wondering at his excitement.</p>

    <p>“What’s your name?” he demanded.</p>

    <p>“Gorgas Levering. Same as it always was.”</p>

    <p>“Thirteen! Jupiter Pluvius! Arrest me, somebody!
        Are you sure your name isn’t Keyser?”</p>

    <p>“Keyser is my sister.”</p>

    <p>“Thank goodness for that. Gorgas! Bad enough.
        But Keyser—ugh!—Are you named after a street?”</p>

    <p>“No; family. What’s the matter? What are you
        looking at me that way for? Counting my freckles?
        Anything wrong with my feet?”</p>

    <p>The professor dropped on the grass and laughed
        himself into exhaustion.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Your—legs,” he got forth finally, but quietly, so
        the wives on the benches could not hear. “Legs—gave
        me—fright. They saved you, though. Hadn’t
        been—for—legs, I might have asked—you to—marry
        me.... Thirteen!... Gracious!...” He
        sobered up suddenly and remarked to the spirits of the
        air, as it were, “There ought to be a law against me.”</p>

    <p>Miss Gorgas Levering sat down again cross-legged.
        She pulled her short skirts over her knees. Then she
        wound her long braid about her head and fastened it
        with a sharp twig. Demurely she looked at him, as her
        elder sister might have done.</p>

    <p>“As you were saying, Professeh Blynn,” she mimicked
        one of her sister’s college friends. “Don’t let
        me interrupt a pro-po-sal. Small offehs of marriage
        cheerfully received. First come, first served.”</p>

    <p>“Your face is quite old enough,” Professor Blynn
        speculated.</p>

    <p>Her features were as womanly as they ever would
        be. Some young girls achieve that sort of maturity
        early; it is only a question of lengthened skirts and
        twisted hair and they grow up over night. Her vocabulary
        was strikingly mature, too; sure sign of much
        reading; and it was streaked with dashes of vigorous
        young thinking. Her strong coloring heightened the
        illusion.</p>

    <p>“I’m an out-of-doors girl,” she explained. “I play
        tennis, you know—really play,” she laughed; “and I
        skate and climb trees and ride.” Then she told him,
        with comical gravity, that she was the beginning of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
        new species, and asked if he had read Gardiner’s “The
        Femine?” “It’s an English book; sort of pamphlet.
        It tells about the coming woman. She will be strong,
        first of all. He didn’t convert me. I was always that.”</p>

    <p>The instinctive teacher in him brought him quickly
        to her level. He did not make fun of her, nor patronize.
        Just the right word or two he said, as he lolled
        on the grass and deliberately stuffed a brier pipe,
        enough to take her off the defensive, a position which
        every intelligent child must assume in the presence of
        superior elders, and led her to communicate naturally.
        He talked to her of modern ideas about woman; although
        his own ideas on the subject were not at all
        formed. “A Doll’s House” had just been translated
        into English and was already creating no end of stir.
        He told her about it. The story of Nora and her vain
        sacrifice caught hold of her active young mind. He
        promised her some books, forgetting completely her
        years as he had done in the beginning; and recommended
        a lot of German “new thought” just emerging
        into translations, rather shocking reading in those days,
        even for males.</p>

    <p>Without any self-consciousness they explored each
        other’s faces as they talked. Certain of his little
        twists of mouth and eye—he had a habit of screwing
        up the left side of his face as he propounded, it seemed
        to assist him as he dug the idea up out of his mind and
        threw it from him—these she stored away without
        meaning to, along with his sudden wrinkling of brow,
        and the odd cock of the neck. Something dramatic in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
        her had always been at work, seizing the high peculiarities
        of folks for the sake of later caricature. She
        did not miss that sly rubbing of the hand along the
        nose, nor his sudden display of white teeth when he
        smiled.</p>

    <p>As a rule, he lost sight of his auditors when he
        spoke. His classes were always a blur, or rather, they
        merged into a single personality, which attended,
        squirmed, laughed as a complete organism. And in
        his successful dealings with very little children—they
        always received him into their intimacies without reserve—he
        had soon discovered that the best results
        were obtained when one does not in the beginning stare
        into their faces. You must look far off down the
        street as you parley with them, or they will catch the
        assumed interest or the lurking irony in your eye, and
        shy off.</p>

    <p>So at first he only glanced up at her occasionally.
        The picture flashed upon his mind was not at all that
        of a child, but of a young woman of his own age, yet
        infinitely more self-absorbed and independent than any
        he could recall. The chin, grasped firmly in her hand
        as she leaned forward, the strong, searching eyes and
        the coiling braid and the absence of legs had their effect
        gradually of making him forget that he was dealing
        with a merely precocious youngster; so, as he warmed
        up to the tale of Helmer and Doctor Rank and Nora,
        he shifted about and watched her animated brown face.</p>

    <p>The sun and the wind and the rain had toned her in
        shades of brown. The hair was black-brown, the eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
        sepia but lustrous and alive, the skin ruddy-brown like
        a young Indian. The fat, short-fingered hand that
        supported the chin was almost cedar.</p>

    <p>The illusion of maturity was enhanced by a flashing
        interpolation or two.</p>

    <p>“Women mustn’t imitate men,” she asserted.
        “That’s silly. Men have some fine things that don’t
        belong just to them; that’s all. Why shouldn’t I ride
        a bicycle? Why shouldn’t I play tennis and get
        tanned? Why shouldn’t I work hard, too, and get all
        there is out of the sport? I’m no jelly fish. Chinese
        women <i>can</i> walk; can’t they? Well, why shouldn’t
        they? I found that in Gardiner, but I thought of it
        myself, long before that.”</p>

    <p>They discussed a possible Chinese woman who had
        revolted, and the consequences in community and family
        persecution. Then she hinted guardedly of some personal
        persecutions. The mother had misgivings.
        There was talk in the family of corralling and branding
        and fitting for market.</p>

    <p>She had never been to school. She had fought
        against it; and they had given in. A nursery maid had
        taught her to read and figure, the rest had taken care
        of itself.</p>

    <p>He admired her immensely then, she was so careful
        not to show a partisan spirit in a matter that so much
        concerned her happiness. The mother was quite right
        to wish her daughters to be alike, she admitted; but it
        is not given even loving mothers to understand all about
        their children. Sacrifice must be made by the children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
        she knew, for mothers must not suffer too much,
        even when they were unwisely restrictive or made laws
        just for the sake of making them. As she spoke thus
        soberly, the little lady seemed really older than the
        man before her.</p>

    <p>Then the spell was shattered.</p>

    <p>“I will <i>never</i> wear a boned waist!” she broke in
        frankly.</p>

    <p>In Mount Airy, twenty-five years ago, one did not
        speak openly of invisible clothing. In school one was
        taught to say limb, and not leg; and no young lady
        ever admitted any public knowledge of petticoats or
        stockings.</p>

    <p>Then Miss Gorgas Levering yanked the twig from
        her braid, stood up, displayed two lithe young legs,
        shedding at once ten years of maturity.</p>

    <p>He stood up, too. “Gorgas,” he began, and then
        stopped to look at her quizzically. “I can’t get used
        to that name,” he smiled. “With ‘Gorgas Lane’ just
        beyond the Unruh farm—” he waved a hand jokingly.</p>

    <p>“But you!” she cried in defense—she knew all
        about him; he was “the professor” and a marked man.
        “‘Allen Blynn’—that’s a lane, too—Allen’s Lane!
        And that’s not so far away, either!”</p>

    <p>Evidently the little lady was sensitive about her odd
        name.</p>

    <p>“But Allen is a regular name,” he protested.</p>

    <p>“So’s Gorgas!... And you’re ‘Allen L. Blynn,’
        too; why, you’re a <i>real</i> ‘lane’!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Oh, I dropped the ‘L’ long ago—when grandmother
        died.”</p>

    <p>“I never had it!” she exulted.</p>

    <p>“But the ‘L’ isn’t for ‘lane,’” he shook his head
        sadly. “It’s much worse—it’s for ‘Lafayette.’”</p>

    <p>“Oh!” she gasped her delight.</p>

    <p>“Much worse, eh?”</p>

    <p>“I should say so!”</p>

    <p>“I take it all back, Gorgas,” he dropped his bantering
        tone, and shook his head so humbly, and smiled so
        pleasantly that she was soon mollified. “We’re both
        named after families, I see—the kind of families that
        have streets named for them; but that ‘Lafayette’ of
        mine is worse than—worse than even ‘Keyser’!”
        Gorgas laughed; one’s own name is never funny, but
        how comic are other persons’! “When Lafayette paid
        Mount Airy the great visit in 1825,” he explained, “he
        made a very formal call on my grandmother—kissed
        her hand, I believe—well, she gave up the remainder
        of her life to bragging about it, and she hoped to perpetuate
        the event by naming me ‘Lafayette.’ Wasn’t
        that a dreadful calamity to put upon a young infant?”</p>

    <p>“Awful!” she agreed heartily.</p>

    <p>“While she lived I had to be ‘Allen L. Blynn,’” he
        smiled ruefully, “But ‘Lafayette’ died with her, bless
        her good old soul. At college when they asked me what
        the ‘L’ stood for, I used to say, ‘Just L.’ You don’t
        know how scared I was lest that crowd should discover
        all about that kiss-the-hand business!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>The middleman and his group came up just then
        and joked obviously about their prowess as players.</p>

    <p>“Getting points from Gorgas?” inquired the middleman.
        “She took the junior cup, you know, and
        against some smart boys, too. At least they thought
        they were smart.”</p>

    <p>The middleman had won both sets that afternoon,
        and could afford to expand. “You know, you tutors
        ought to be tutored before you take us on again. That
        might make you—”</p>

    <p>“Astuter?” suggested the professor.</p>

    <p>His grin was not at the jest. He was thinking of
        Gorgas, standing erect and brown as young Pocahontas,
        and looking very like that famous lady. The
        frown had not yet gone from her eyes. She would not
        wear—! Bless her! He could see her years later in
        all the tortures and disguises that women permit themselves
        to indulge in, including the ugly balloon sleeves,
        which were already enveloping very young girls; and
        pyramidal high-heeled shoes; perhaps even a “bustle.”</p>

    <p>Someone asked the time.</p>

    <p>“Jee-ru-salem!” whispered Gorgas. “I’ve got to
        cut it home.”</p>

    <p>“Tell your mother I’m coming by on Wednesday
        afternoon. At about three. I’m looking over that
        Williams boy at two. It’s near you, you know.”</p>

    <p>“Very good, Professor Blynn.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Mr.</i> Blynn, if you don’t mind.”</p>

    <p>“Very good, Mr. Blynn.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Stay around Wednesday, will you? I want to talk
        some more.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Very</i> good, Mr. Blynn.”</p>

    <p>“Come around; you’ll find me in.”</p>

    <p>The frown was entirely gone. She was smiling at
        her own “poetry” as she moved off.</p>

    <p>“I’ll find you out, too, if I kin,” he threw back.</p>

    <p>She walked two or three swift steps down the path
        before she retorted, without looking around:</p>

    <p>“No, you won’t. You’ll simply ‘chin.’”</p>

    <p>This was a pleasant blow at his profession. He <i>was</i>
        a talker. Only that very morning he had written in an
        “album”—it was a day of albums—answers to questions
        that bared him to the core.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>What is your occupation? Deliverer of addresses.</p>

        <p>What would you rather be? Maker of speeches.</p>

        <p>What is your favorite game? Conversation.</p>

        <p>What game do you most dislike? Conversation of
            others.</p>
    </div>

    <p>He watched her as she walked swiftly down the path.
        Good-looking youngsters do hold the eye! The suggestion
        of young Indian persisted, the ideal Indian
        maiden of Hiawatha: she was so brown; the hair fell
        in an enormous black braid; her form was almost curveless;
        and she strode along with all the motion in her
        gliding feet, her lithe body as steady and as straight
        as a young poplar.</p>

    <p>She disappeared for a moment in the dip of a gully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
        then rose again and dwindled slowly down the long path
        across a field. With folded arms he stared after her,
        thinking of many things: of the beauty of young childhood,
        a wondrous, vanishing thing; of her active,
        mature mind, caged up in that child’s frame; of—at
        the end of the path she turned swiftly, as if she knew
        he was there, and shot a hand high in the air as a parting
        salute. He waved back instantaneously. He could
        watch her for two minutes longer, until she crossed the
        railroad. But she trudged sturdily on and did not look
        back again.</p>

        <h3 class="nobreak">II<br>

            GYPSIES!</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THE Williams boy, a well-built little man of
        eleven, was a healthy, riotous animal, keen,
        fluent and right-minded—but he had not
        been “promoted.” Blynn had found this out in an
        accidental meeting with the lad. The result was a
        regular Wednesday afternoon visit at the boy’s home
        with a new sort of “lessons,” and many tramps down
        Cresheim creek and up the Wissahickon—the core of
        the method—where instruction was part of the game.</p>

    <p>Blynn had the teacher’s gift of presenting unknown
        regions of knowledge with all the allurements of advertisement
        of seaside estates. He aroused interest, a
        desire to explore, a proper pride in achievement; and,
        above all, hope. He never complained of stupidity, nor
        expressed the least impatience with slowness; so in this
        way he ever stirred up latent or lost personal faiths.
        Within a few months the Williams boy was ready to
        pass into the next grade and do himself credit; unless
        the well-intentioned but narrow school dames of the
        Hall should petrify his interest and with daily croakings
        cut off all communication.</p>

    <p>Gorgas was standing in the fine old doorway of her
        home when he came out of the Williams’ gate. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
        waved to her cheerfully; she saluted gravely in return,
        one lift of the hand, as the Roman stage-senators do.
        When he came forward eagerly, his severe face alight
        with interest, she stood watching him without motion.
        That was a characteristic of Gorgas which she had
        possessed as a baby and which she maintained all her
        life; it gave charming dignity to her later years; active
        at one moment as the famous imps below, the next
        moment rigid as a wax-work, yet thunderingly alive, a
        fawn struck into silence, listening.</p>

    <p>Not until he stood beside her did she move. Then
        abruptly she thrust out a hand.</p>

    <p>“How do you do, Mr. Blynn,” she smiled an absurd,
        artificial smile, the perfect mask of a hostess. “<i>Won’t</i>
        you sit down? It’s <i>awful</i> good of you to call.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Wie geht’s</i>, milady?” he bowed in perfect understanding
        of the game. “Excuse! I haff been talking
        zee Cherman <i>Sprache mit</i> dot Wilhelm’s poy <i>und</i> I cannot
        get back to English for several <i>minuten</i> after-varts,
        afterwarts—afterwards—there! My tongue’s free.
        <i>’Raus mit ihm! Gesundheit!</i> How are you? <i>Schreckliches
            Wetter</i>—I mean, sticky weather, isn’t it?”
    </p>

    <p>They had reached the living room by this time.
        A glance about had not revealed Mrs. Levering or the
        older daughter. No doubt, they would be forthcoming
        later.</p>

    <p>“The weather <i>is</i> rather depressing,” she drawled.
        The tone struck him as decidedly familiar; but when
        she opened her large eyes and blinked deliberately at
        him twice, and then drew a languid hand across one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
        cheek and fidgeted a moment in her chair, as if to distribute
        an imaginary “bustle,” it came to him with a
        rush that she was picturing Mrs. Williams, whom he
        had just left.</p>

    <p>Blynn squeezed down into his chair, thrust his head
        into his neck, puffed out his cheek, a recognizable
        portrait of Mr. Williams, and growled.</p>

    <p>“I don’t like it! I don’t like it! I don’t like it at
        all!”</p>

    <p>In a moment or two they were caricaturing the
        neighborhood and making guesses as to the portrait.</p>

    <p>He didn’t say, “That isn’t fair,” or “You shouldn’t
        mimic your elders that way”; nor did he begin any
        sentence with, “It isn’t nice for young girls to—”
        Instead, he joined in, became particeps criminis, and at
        once was initiated into the secretest of fraternities, the
        brotherhood of children. In a little while he had won
        the right to ask her any personal question he wished
        without once being suspected of school-teachering.</p>

    <p>He wanted to know what she was reading.</p>

    <p>“‘Man and Wife,’” she told him.</p>

    <p>Wilkie Collins wrote it, and Professor Blynn did not
        know that! It was about a Scotch marriage, she explained:
        two persons had unwittingly acknowledged
        themselves man and wife before witnesses; that was
        enough to bind them in irrevocable marriage.</p>

    <p>Her explanations were clear—evidently she knew
        what she was reading—and she talked of marriage and
        children with extraordinary frankness.</p>

    <p>“At the same time I am reading ‘<i>La Peau de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
            Chagrin’ par Honoré Balzac</i>,” this with a breathless
        kind of mystery.</p>

    <p>The change of <i>timbre</i> as the French name floated out
        musically brought Blynn to sudden attention.</p>

    <p>“You speak French?” he inquired incredulously.
        He knew that she had never gone to school, and that
        among Mount Airy families it was not then customary
        to have governesses.</p>

    <p>“Assez pour m’ faire comprendre,” she came back
        quickly. “Et vous, m’sieur? Vous l’parlez aussi?”</p>

    <p>“Where on earth did you learn the language?” he
        showed his admiration for her glib prowess. “I read
        easily enough. It cost me the hardest kind of grubbing,
        too. But I couldn’t talk it two minutes.”</p>

    <p>She grew suddenly statuesque.</p>

    <p>“Who taught you?” he persisted.</p>

    <p>“Bardek,” she whispered. “You must not tell.
        You will not tell?”</p>

    <p>He crossed his heart.</p>

    <p>“It’s a great secret. Mother must not know. Bardek
        is Bohemian; he speaks all languages.”</p>

    <p>“Who is Bardek?”</p>

    <p>She lowered her voice.</p>

    <p>“Promise you won’t tell.”</p>

    <p>He promised readily.</p>

    <p>“Bardek is a gypsy, I think; but he doesn’t travel.
        He lives in the old mill in Cresheim Valley. I ride in the
        mornings, you know, very often alone. He talks to me
        in French and tells me how to say things.”</p>

    <p>“How long have you been doing this?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Three years.”</p>

    <p>“Since you were ten?”</p>

    <p>“Yes; that’s when I got ‘Gyp.’”</p>

    <p>“‘Gyp’ is a horse?”</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>“Cresheim Valley in the mornings is a rather lonely
        spot, eh?”</p>

    <p>“Yes; that makes it fine! There’s absolutely not a
        soul about between seven and eight. If anyone comes,
        I step into the old mill.”</p>

    <p>“Merciful heavens!” said Blynn, but not aloud.
        Nothing in his manner betrayed the slightest hint of
        anything but entire acquiescence in the policy of meeting
        gypsies in an unfrequented valley between seven
        and eight in the morning.</p>

    <p>“He teaches me other things, too,” she went on.
        “I’ve never told this to anyone but you; not a person.
        We seem so well acquainted—after yesterday. Perhaps
        I oughtn’t to tell you. It’s been a terrible thing
        to keep to myself. They think—” motioning toward
        the house—“I pick up French out of books, the way
        I get most things. I do hammered copper and silver
        inlay, too; Bardek taught me. But I don’t get practice
        enough. Bardek says one must give a life to it.
        He makes beautiful things, and sells them to rich people.”</p>

    <p>“Do you pay him?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no!” she smiled in a superior way. “Bardek
        is above money.”</p>

    <p>“Ugh!” thought Blynn. He seemed to remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
        a dirty, fat man, pounding away on something at the
        mouth of the ruined paper-mill. He had rings in his
        ears, and a pair of huge mustachios gave him a villainous
        air.</p>

    <p>“I have tried to give him money. But he stopped
        all that in no time. He took me inside and showed me
        a cunning box set in a stone in the mill. It was full of
        gold—oh!”</p>

    <p>The “oh” was uttered with quick anguish. Blynn
        came swiftly to her chair and raised her head. Tears
        were flooding her eyes, and her face was screwed up into
        a horrid attempt to suppress the noise of weeping.</p>

    <p>“What is the matter, my dear child?” he asked
        again and again.</p>

    <p>Several times she tried to speak. Evidently from her
        glances toward the door she feared someone would be
        aware of a break in her voice; so with heroic efforts
        she shut back the sobs.</p>

    <p>“I have—told! I—have—told! I promised
        not—to tell. I have told—you. It is—all right—I—know.
        You would keep—it—a—secret.
        But it hurts—that—I—have told. Bardek has
        been—so—good to me. It was—wicked.”</p>

    <p>It was simply an accident, he assured her. Quietly
        he soothed her. “We are pals now,” he told her.
        This would make them into a league of secrecy. She
        could trust him. All his life he had been a father-confessor
        to children. He was tested. Keeping a secret
        like that was hard for her. Now it would be easier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
        Some things are almost too much to hold. She nodded.
        One must have outlets. Mothers were made for that
        purpose. She looked worried at that, so he took a
        quick turn. Sometimes even mothers couldn’t just
        understand; then one must have a pal or “bust.” Her
        eyes showed approval. A pal must know everything.
        No secrets from pals. That seemed to be agreed. He
        would go with her to Bardek some day soon—she
        showed half-frightened wonder at the plan—well, they
        would talk it over like good comrades later. Someone
        was coming.</p>

    <p>“My name is Mum,” he nodded, “second-cousin to
        Dumb.”</p>

    <p>She gave him a look of wild approval as Mrs. Levering
        appeared from the rear of the house; she was dressed
        for travel and hurrying.</p>

    <p>“Why, Professor Blynn, I declare!” the good lady
        was obviously surprised at his presence. “I am particularly
        pleased to see you. Harold Williams has been
        praising you to me and telling all about you. You’ve
        done wonders with that boy—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no! no! God and his good mother are responsible
        for all the wonders. A fine little fellow, he is.
        Somebody got on the wrong side of him; that’s all.”</p>

    <p>“But why didn’t I know you were here?” She
        looked mildly at Gorgas.</p>

    <p>Blynn hastened to explain.</p>

    <p>“I was talking with Gorgas last Saturday afternoon
        at the tennis-courts—”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Ah! You came to talk about Gorgas. Good!
        The very thing I have been thinking of myself. I wish
        I had known you were coming, for I must be off to our
        little literary club. We’re fined if we don’t come on
        time,” she smiled as if the matter were unimportant.
        “Don’t let me seem abrupt, but I have only a half-minute.
        So let me come out bluntly. I want you to
        take Gorgas’ education in charge; look her over; find
        out where she needs patching and repainting. I declare
        she has grown up out of babyhood before I am ready.
        It is almost ungracious of her. I must blame somebody.
        She is thirteen years old, and doesn’t know anything.
        My fault, I know; but you’re a wonder—everybody
        says so. You’ll do it; won’t you?... Oh,
        yes. I must be practical. Everybody is poor nowadays—the
        Democrats are in, you know!—I must
        inquire about prices. What do you charge by the
        hour? I must ask for wholesale rates, for Mr. Levering’s
        wholesale, you know, and always gets discounts!”</p>

    <p>Generations of Pennsylvania-German thrift beamed
        coldly from her eyes, although the rest of her ample
        person actually smiled.</p>

    <p>“Absolutely nothing an hour, Mrs. Levering.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no!” she protested, but she looked relieved.
        “I will not hear of that. The Democrats haven’t
        brought us that low—yet. Although goodness only
        knows what’s to happen next. I really believe they
        caused that blizzard last March! Well! We’ll talk it
        over later. But you’ll have to charge something. It’s
        your business, man, and a tough job you’ll have,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
        twitching Gorgas’ ears affectionately. “Reading
        novels and riding Gyp—that’s this little girl’s idea of
        getting an education!”</p>

    <p>“All right, Mrs. Levering, we’ll talk it over later.
        But I make it a rule never to charge for this sort of out-of-school
        work. I like to do it. It’s my fun. But you
        may give me a dinner occasionally. We teachers do
        get hungry for good food—and good company!”</p>

    <p>“A bargain!” the lady called out happily. “But
        I’m off. I’ll be late. You’ve cost me a quarter-dollar
        fine, young man. Dinners? If you do anything with
        Gorgas I’ll take you in as a permanent boarder. Day-day,
        child. Goodby, Mr. Blynn. Sorry I couldn’t
        stay. Gorgas,” she was at the door now, “get Louisa
        to make a nice cool drink. And give the Professor
        something to eat. Don’t ever let him get hungry!”
        Her laugh carried her down the steps.</p>

    <p>As they picnicked on the back-lawn, his instinct told
        him to keep away from the Bardek story, to act as if it
        were a thing to be forgotten. Only when he was ready
        to go, and she seemed to have an unwonted appearance
        of depression, he repeated his promise to keep the
        matter secret until she would wish him to tell. This
        seemed to brighten her tremendously; for she was terribly
        downcast at the thought of her failure. Now she
        seemed to be almost her buoyant self.</p>

    <p>“You did not tell your mother I was coming,” he
        remarked.</p>

    <p>“No.” But she did not seem troubled.</p>

    <p>“Nor your sister?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“No,” very seriously, “they were both going out.
        I was afraid if I told them they might stay home.”</p>

    <p>Then the comical side of her statement struck her.
        They both laughed over it as they shook hands.</p>

    <p>“Goodby, pupil,” he waved, “see you later.”</p>

    <p>“If you don’t forget the date-r,” she rhymed.</p>

    <p>“I’ll sure be there, I beg to state-r,” he returned
        as he moved off.</p>

    <p>“Wednesday next at this here gate-r,” she called
        after him, gleeful to get the last rhyme.</p>

    <p>He shook his head and threw up his hands as if she
        had scored heavily against him. That was an instinctive
        trick of his, to make children feel the keen joy of a
        mental victory. It gave her a little glow for hours
        afterward, as he knew it would, and quite saved her
        from a far-off conscience which told her she had not
        been faithful to Bardek.</p>

        <h3 class="nobreak">III<br>

            THE OLD PAPER MILL</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">BLYNN found himself tremendously interested in
        the business of teaching young persons, but he
        always discounted that enthusiasm. Scholarship,
        he felt, was his predestined occupation. Not that
        he really knew any good reason why the work of a delver
        in past documents should be especially worthy; nor did
        he ever inquire whether a life given to Elizabethan
        dramatists could be a life well spent. He enjoyed that
        sort of thing, but he had the collector’s instinct, not the
        scholar’s, although he did not know that; he carried on
        his readings and note-takings and classifyings as an
        amateur might collect butterflies. The figure fails in
        one important respect: all butterflies are beautiful.
        Better, he was like certain dealers in antique: ugly old
        furniture and bric-a-brac were sorted out with the same
        reverent care as the really beautiful. Six hundred a
        year—the beginner’s salary—seemed a magnificent
        return for tasks that he would willingly have performed,
        if he could have afforded it, without money and without
        price.</p>

    <p>He did not know until much later that he was an exceptional
        teacher. Youngsters got the habit of confiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
        their academic troubles to him; and whether it were
        algebra or English grammar or poetry, he had the gift
        of making straight roads through the difficulties, and
        of charging his young friends with desire to go ahead.</p>

    <p>A so-called stupid child or “bad” boys who wouldn’t
        study, these always seized his interest. Before he knew
        it, he had a dozen young folks on his list whose whole
        educational life he had surreptitiously taken possession
        of. The Williams boy was one; and now Gorgas
        had been added.</p>

    <p>Gorgas Levering was an interesting “case” to Blynn.
        Through unwitting neglect, the child was out of touch
        with her parents and possibly in danger. Evidently
        she had a magnificent will, almost the only thing needful
        with the right sort of teacher, but perilous if it is
        coerced or left to drive its own unaided bent. The
        thought of her three years’ intimacy with the Bohemian
        Bardek gave Blynn a physical chill.</p>

    <p>Bardek had done wonderful things with her, the
        French, for instance; she had the very tang of a native,
        even the shrugs and almost inimitable twists of hand and
        head. Blynn recognized the method; it was his own;
        and he respected Bardek’s results as a fellow-craftsman
        would; but he was not sure that he should respect Bardek’s
        morals.</p>

    <p>She was the most interesting of all the children he had
        semi-officially under his charge, but she was something
        else. The memory of that illusion of maturity he could
        not dissipate by any amount of concentration upon the
        sum of her actual years. She had come at him first as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
        a young woman challenging him to meet her on equal
        terms, and had stirred him as Olivia had been stirred
        by the disguised Viola. Some of the suggestion of that
        mistake continued to stay with him. The grave brown
        eyes searched him as he talked, and threw him into the
        half-belief that some witch had taken a woman and had
        given her the shape and habiliments of a child.</p>

    <p>As he walked along the unfrequented streets of Mount
        Airy he scolded himself aloud for his shameful imaginings;
        but he could not shake them off. He reminded
        himself of Olivia fancying herself in love with Viola, and
        laughed. “Perhaps it is not Gorgas, but her sister.
        It really was brother Sebastian in the play. I’ll look
        her up. Keyser will—Keyser!—Bolts and shackles!
        What a name!”</p>

    <p>One day he contrived, therefore, to chat with Miss
        Keyser, and so they arranged to spend an afternoon
        driving together. But on the way to “look Keyser
        up” he lapsed into a contemplation of the first meeting
        with Gorgas at the tennis-courts. “If this were Italy,”
        he grinned, “the thing would be simple enough; or even
        ‘Little Italy,’”—the near-by city’s Italian colony—“Thirteen,
        I hear, is rather the proper age there. At
        fifteen the little Italians either have <i>bambinos</i> or they
        are on the shelf. Wasn’t Lady Devereaux, Sidney’s
        famous Stella, about that age? I’ll have to look up
        precedents. Beatrice? Dante’s Beatrice? She was a
        ‘fourteener,’ wasn’t she? And Juliet! Ah! Juliet was
        just thirteen!” He quoted humorously from the play,
        “‘On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
        shall she, marry.’... Guess Shakespeare knew what
        he was about!... I’ve had a sad jar. Those legs!
        And the braid, and the silly ribbon!... I haven’t
        felt so cheap since—”</p>

    <p>He laughed aloud suddenly and set a frightened little
        spaniel barking with fury.</p>

    <p>“Go it, old boy,” he called. “You aren’t half so
        startled as I was.... Well,” he nodded his head vigorously.
        “She gave me a little insight into myself and
        into what’s coming to me some day, I expect. The next
        time, I hope it will be a real woman. Just the same,
        I’m going to be always grateful to the little witch for
        the deception; and I’ll pay, too.”... He closed his
        lips with determination. “That Bardek fellow will be
        looked into—migh-ty care-ful-ly, I tell you, boy....
        He’s been putting things in her head, I warrant....
        Thought all that wise talk was second-handed....
        Where did she ever come across Gardiner’s ‘Femine’?
        Heavens! Why, it’s full of rot, just the sort of thing
        to upset a girl and persuade her that wrong is right....
        But I must be careful. If we drive her sort—”
        He threw up his hands.</p>

    <p>Miss Keyser Levering was already waiting in the little
        two-seated family carriage.</p>

    <p>“Am I late?” he asked cheerfully.</p>

    <p>“No; I’m early,” she responded, digging under the
        seat for a rug. “That shows that you don’t know me
        as well as you should. Some people are always two
        minutes late. My specialty is being two minutes early.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
        Jump in; I’m going to drive. This ‘off’ animal is
        ‘Sorry,’ not ‘Gyp’; ‘Sorry’ has to be handled by one
        of the family. ‘Gyp’ is never in the stable days like
        this.”</p>

    <p>At the mention of “Gyp,” Blynn’s mental ears stood
        up, but he got into the carriage with much irrelevant
        jesting over the relation between horses and horse-sense.</p>

    <p>“Where is Gorgas?” he asked casually.</p>

    <p>“Off with ‘Gyp,’ as always.” The sister was not
        concerned.</p>

    <p>“‘Gyp’ is mild, I suppose?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes; stupid.”</p>

    <p>“Which way did she go?”</p>

    <p>“Her usual—down Cresheim Valley.”</p>

    <p>They trotted off toward Chestnut Hill. Blynn broke
        into a chatty strain until they had turned into the pike
        which marks the county line.</p>

    <p>“Let’s go up the Wissahickon,” he suggested. “You
        can turn off here and go through Cresheim.”</p>

    <p>After leaving Main Street they plunged into the
        Cresheim Valley, which in the eighteenth century was a
        thriving industrial center, with prosperous mills—three
        or four of them—busy at the manufacture of
        hosiery and paper. One has only to recall the conspicuous
        masculine leg of that century to know the
        demand for proper hose, and when one is reminded that
        Cresheim Valley produced the paper for the printing
        of the Declaration of Independence, the historic setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
        is made; but steam, trousers, and a less rebellious time
        had passed the hand of oblivion over the once busy vale.</p>

    <p>As a result, the old road was ragged and rocky, and
        the only sign that broke the effect of forest primeval
        was the ruins of two of the old mills, a half-broken dam,
        and a dangerous looking mill race.</p>

    <p>Blynn kept to the safe rôle of talker; but inwardly he
        chafed and worried. Somewhere down in those leafy
        depths an unknown foreigner was enticing a young girl
        to come to him....</p>

    <p>He scrutinized both sides of the road as he neared the
        ruined paper-mill. Tethered among the bushes he knew
        “Gyp” was peacefully cropping. He listened and
        watched, but at no time lost his cue in the small talk;
        and was repaid by a slight movement of the bushes and
        the sight of a long nose reaching for green branches.</p>

    <p>“Sorry” neighed in greeting and stretched his head
        to look; but “Gyp” withdrew directly to munch his
        bunch of leaves.</p>

    <p>“Has ‘Gyp’ a white star on his nose?” he asked.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” she replied. “Do you see her?”</p>

    <p>“No,” he looked the other way. “I just guessed.
        Most horses do.”</p>

    <p>Below the mill he claimed to have dropped a glove,
        got out, and ran swiftly back.</p>

    <p>Only one dilapidated corner of the ancient paper-mill
        was still standing, and that had to be reached via a
        bridge of logs. Canvas was fastened over holes in the
        roof, and odds and ends of boards made a patch-work
        flooring, through which the rushing mill race could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
        clearly seen. The waters below swirled noisily over
        rocks and fallen masonry.</p>

    <p>Save for an old stool, some rag rugs and a mass of

            “THAT NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE”</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap2">ALMOST as Blynn surveyed the empty mill he
        knew he had made a mistake in coming at all,
        and was instantly eager to get out unobserved.
        He knew what a child would think of this sort of spying
        and how it would take weeks of building up to get back
        the lost confidence. Particularly was it important just
        now to maintain the genuine intimacy which had
        miraculously grown up between them in so short a time.
        As he stumbled up the rocky Valley road he was apprehensive
        of seeing and being seen.</p>

    <p>Perhaps Bardek and she had been watching from
        near-by bushes. That thought chilled him. Mixed with
        the fear of losing the child’s faith in him as trusty pal
        was the quick antagonism against that other pal, who
        was no doubt with her now in this wild spot.</p>

    <p>It was a case for slow treatment. Hurry would spoil
        all. To come near the rendezvous at all was a grave
        mistake, he told himself; he had obeyed an impulse,
        purely a personal one, too, and it was an impulse which
        his mind should have resolutely checked. It shamed
        him a little to think how amateurishly he had acted,
        after all his knowledge of the mind of children.</p>

    <p>Gorgas must take him to Bardek in her own good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
        time. One must play a waiting game and trust mightily
        that all would be well.</p>

    <p>He regained the carriage, exhibited a glove and took
        up the dropped conversation.</p>

    <p>“I don’t agree with you about the Duke,” he continued.
        Miss Levering had seen “Twelfth Night” recently
        and had read it over to prepare herself for a conversation
        with a university instructor. “The Duke
        behaves quite properly, if you will agree with my
        theory.”</p>

    <p>“He was a goose,” commented the lady, “groaning
        over his countess and not having the gumption to go up
        to her and talk it out. And in the last act he whisks
        over to Viola just because she puts on dresses. Shakespeare
        nodded when he made the Duke; that’s my theory.”</p>

    <p>“Let me tell you mine,” said Blynn. “To the
        Elizabethan, love was an infection, a kind of pestilence,
        like the plague, which one caught from another. Once
        you have it you are ill. You become moody, put on
        gay clothes, wash your face, and demand sad songs.
        They sold medicines, love philters to give the disease,
        and hate potions to cure it. A chap usually knew
        when he had caught the pesky thing, but he was not
        always sure of the source. Well, the Duke had a bad
        case. He got it from the boy Cesario, who was really,
        as you know, a charming young lady disguised. Now
        the very salt of the play is the Duke’s blunders in
        guessing who played the trick on him. The Elizabethan
        audience understood that joke and enjoyed
        every one of his false moves toward the conquest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
        Countess. It’s as if a fellow had the influenza and
        began to treat himself as if he had sunburn. Every
        application of cold cream and every sneeze would be
        comedy to the onlooker. So in the end, when the Duke
        discovers the cause of his trouble he promptly marries
        it; as most of us do. Oh, he isn’t a bit inconsistent, if
        you understand Elizabethan love.”</p>

    <p>“Well, that only proves the play is founded on an
        error,” she persisted. “If you must have a lot of historic
        learning to appreciate a play, it is not great
        drama. I insist, Shakespeare nodded.”</p>

    <p>“What makes you so certain that love is not a
        plague?”</p>

    <p>“It may be, for all I know,” she parried. “But I
        should think two modern young people would know
        when they—”</p>

    <p>“But do they, always? A man may behave exactly
        like the Duke, have all the symptoms, and not guess for
        the longest while what really is the matter with him.
        Frequently he blames it on the wrong lady. Sometimes
        somebody has to take him aside and speak roundly to
        him—the girl’s father, for instance. And there are
        enough bad marriages to make me believe that lovers
        often make a wrong diagnosis. It’s still a mystery to
        me. Cupid and his arrows was not a bad theory. He
        was a wretched shot, you know; frightfully bad. That
        would explain a lot of mismating.”</p>

    <p>“But the Countess?” she persisted. “She wanted
        to marry a woman just because she found her dressed
        in man’s clothing; and what did she do later?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
        Promptly switched off to the lady’s brother, Sebastian.
        There! I have settled your theory. She had never
        seen Sebastian before. She couldn’t get any—any
        pestilence or plague from a man who wasn’t about.”</p>

    <p>Blynn laughed. “I didn’t want to lecture to you;
        but the theory is rather complicated and you have hit
        upon a fine illustration. How far can love carry? We
        say, as far as one can see distinctly. The Elizabethans
        put no limit—as far as the ends of the earth, to the
        very stars and back again.</p>

    <p>“Beatrice and Benedict are in love long before they
        know it. Petruchio has picked out his Katharine before
        he sees her. Viola is in love with the Duke the moment
        she hears his name. You see, they took their cue from
        the carrying power of the mysterious plague. Look the
        way La Grippe is ravaging us; and we think it has
        travelled from the Far East. Besides, they believed the
        stars arranged all this sort of thing. We don’t believe
        in fate. Therefore we make ourselves too wise. I incline
        toward the Elizabethan theory. Do you know
        Crashaw’s lines ‘To His Supposed Mistress’?</p>

    <p>“I’m content to believe in ‘the shady leaves of destiny.’”</p>

    <p>Miss Levering was busy managing “Sorry,” who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
        seemed restive. His ears were perked ahead, and he
        tossed his head nervously.</p>

    <p>“Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, boy,” she soothed. “He
        sees something strange. There’s a man sitting on the
        roadside with a lot of pails around him. Trust
        ‘Sorry’ for picking out anything unusual.”</p>

    <p>Blynn looked forward, but from his side of the carriage
        could see nothing.</p>

    <p>“It’s a tramp, I suppose,” she conjectured. “They
        roost in here. Looks like a travelling tinker. ‘Whoa,
        Sorry! It’s all right, boy!’ If I talk to him he calms
        down. ‘Whoa, Sorry! Keep your head down,
        boy!’”</p>

    <p>The man came into view; he was seated on a log hammering
        at a copper disk, a swarthy, stoutish fellow. A
        huge gold watch-chain stared out from his waistcoat.
        He wore no collar. A faded soft hat was decorated
        with a long turkey-feather. The costume, plus a large
        mustachio and much unshaved stubble, gave him an air
        of vagabondia.</p>

    <p>“Sorry” slowed down and dug into the ground; the
        man looked up with smiling face.</p>

    <p>“<i>Bon jour, la compagnie!</i>” he saluted, flourishing
        his hammer. Broad rings flashed from his fat hands.</p>

    <p>Blynn searched about for traces of companions. The
        tall bushes gave no sign.</p>

    <p>“<i>Bon jour</i>, Bardek,” returned Miss Levering.
        “Whoa, Sorry, you fool. It’s only Bardek. Bardek
        won’t eat you; whoa, boy!”</p>

    <p>“<i>Mais, oui!</i>” laughed Bardek. “<i>Il sait bien qu’ j’en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
            ai souvent mangé du ch’val!</i> The horse-flesh is vairy
        good.”</p>

    <p>Blynn leaned forward to talk to him. Here was a
        fine chance to get acquainted.</p>

    <p>“Good afternoon,” he greeted. “My French isn’t
        good enough to expose to the open air. I’ll have to talk
        English. Do you under<i>stand</i>—”</p>

    <p>But “Sorry” had evidently comprehended Bardek’s
        cannibalistic reference to the joy of eating horse-flesh,
        for he jolted Blynn down hard on the seat. At the
        syllable “—<i>stand</i>” Allen Blynn had abruptly sat. As
        they shot briskly up the drive, Blynn looked back to see
        the round face of Bardek extended in malevolent
        laughter.</p>

    <p>When they had settled down into a normal pace,
        Blynn inquired,</p>

    <p>“Who is this Bardek? Seems to me I have seen him
        often hanging about this region.”</p>

    <p>“He’s a Frenchman—at least, I think he is French.
        Sort of a vagabond mender of kettles. I don’t know
        how he gets his living. He seems always well-fed and
        contented. He has a wife off there somewhere, and a
        couple of babes-in-the-woods. He comes and goes.
        Sometimes he is away for weeks on his rounds. We
        often stop to chat with him, Gorgas and I. Drat that
        animal. He ought to know Bardek. I’m ashamed of
        him. It was that big vase-like thing that scared him.
        He’d jump at a new tin-cup.”</p>

    <p>They talked of the horses, then, as they emerged from
        a side-road, of the beauty of the Wissahickon Valley, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
        lovely unchronicled spot in American scenery, Miss
        Levering steering the conversation by gentle steps back
        to “Twelfth Night.”</p>

    <p>“I’m almost converted to the Elizabethan view,” she
        admitted. “I’ve been going over in my mind a number
        of girls I know who have confessed how the man came,
        saw, and conquered. Girls do gabble, if it is dark
        enough, especially just after the marriage. They all
        talk like your Elizabethans, claim to have been destined
        for each other from the beginning, and so on; yet they
        all fought the man off at first; all except one girl—the
        man tried to get away from her, but something—your
        ‘shady destiny’—what was it?—got him at
        last.... It’s a horrid thought.”</p>

    <p>“Why?”</p>

    <p>“Well, it takes all choice away. Heavens! You
        might be destined to marry the lamp-lighter! I
        shouldn’t want to catch anything from ‘Aurora.’”</p>

    <p>“Aurora,” the lamp-lighter, was one-armed and
        weather-beaten and gnarled like an ancient mariner;
        his classical name was a Levering invention.</p>

    <p>The winding Wissahickon curled over its rocks far
        below, and thick trees covered every hill. An occasional
        carriage passed, mostly elegant broughams with liveried
        footmen and milady taking her afternoon drive; bicycles
        whizzed by with much churning of warning bells.
        Near the “Hill” Miss Levering cut off into a secluded
        side-road roofed by old trees.</p>

    <p>Keyser Levering was twenty-two, and had been grown
        up and more or less her own master since she was fifteen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
        yet she felt just a little self-conscious on two counts.
        First she was alone in the secluded woodland with a
        young man. Of course, a chaperone would have been
        absurd; America had adopted the European chaperone
        for only very official affairs. In the ’80’s she would not
        have thought of going to the theater with him without
        elderly assistance, but she was permitted by the code
        to take him driving up the Wissahickon.</p>

    <p>Secondly, she had dared openly to discuss with him
        the awful topic of love. To be sure, they had done
        it in an academic setting. Who could object to a
        learned consideration of Elizabethan literature?
        Nevertheless, she was not unmindful of the personal
        modern application of Elizabethan “theory.”</p>

    <p>She did not want to become personally involved. Her
        instincts would have fought off any attempt on the
        young man’s part to bring the topic up to date; yet she
        found herself, mothlike, desiring him to do just that.
        His Elizabethan theory of maidens disturbed by unknown
        forces, holding out willing hands to nameless
        gentlemen, and hardly sure of recognizing the rescuer
        when he appeared—that was not only a startling idea
        to her, but it struck surprisingly near a description of
        her own state.</p>

    <p>For a year or more she had been in a stupor of daydreams
        over that “not impossible He” that should
        command her heart and her. He took no visible shape
        in her mind, but remained near and yet disappointingly
        aloof and shadowy. Sometimes she had the palpitating
        feeling that he was just around the corner, that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
        nearing foot-falls could be heard. At other times she
        was sure she was dancing with him or talking to him
        over a dinner table. Many a young man was flattered
        by her searching gaze or by the subtle intimacy which
        she contrived to throw into a simple personal question.</p>

    <p>Once during the previous winter Blynn had been
        frightened off by one of these moods of hers, and she
        knew it and was ashamed. The last thing she meant to
        do was to apprise this young man of her quest. He was
        being probed and cross-questioned; that was all; but he
        had not understood, and had misnamed her, coquette.</p>

    <p>This pleasant jog among the leafy bowers of the
        Wissahickon, charged as it was by thoughts of Gorgas
        and her perilous rendezvous with Bardek, caused the
        professor to recast his idea of Keyser Levering. They
        had talked of love, to be sure, and she had held to the
        topic deliberately; yet with her eye and a considerable
        part of her attention necessarily on the horses, she had
        carried on the chat strictly like a graduate student.
        Of course, she knew the man. One flashing side-long
        glance from her fine, brown eyes would have sent him
        flying to cover and to silence.</p>

    <p>Along the shaded road they stopped to admire the
        wonder of the place, and to allow the horses to drink at
        a spring. While “Sorry” and “Ned” cropped the
        bushes the two humans nibbled sandwiches and talked.</p>

    <p>Miss Levering’s questions showed intelligence; that
        is, they showed that she knew how to stir up the lecturer
        in him. She wanted to consider him carefully; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
        she prodded him gently with artful interrogations; and
        kept him to his “theory.”</p>

    <p>“What brought Petruchio from Verona to Padua?”
        Blynn asked, as he might have questioned a student.</p>

    <p>“I have forgotten the details of the play,” she replied,
        “I think he said he had come to marry a rich
        wife.”</p>

    <p>“Exactly,” Blynn nodded. “He was drawn to
        Padua as I have seen a butterfly drawn unerringly to
        its mate across miles of country. Of course, Petruchio
        didn’t know what was sending him forth; any more than
        he knew why his diaphragm was pumping air into his
        lungs, or why invisible Neptune influences our tides, or
        why a green weed will suddenly spring into a gold and
        white daisy. Life is so crowded with intelligent mysterious
        design that it is difficult to believe that anything
        happens haphazard.”</p>

    <p>“I wonder if my young man has left Verona,” the
        lady commented with a comic sigh. “I’m getting on!
        Twenty-two, you know.” She shook her head with grotesque
        sadness. “He’ll have to hurry or—I’ll be
        travelling out to meet him.”</p>

    <p>“He may be nearer than Verona,” Blynn essayed, still
        in the seriousness of his exposition. “He may be right
        here,” waving his hand.</p>

    <p>The outright smile on her face caught his eye and
        brought him to earth. “All right,” he assented
        cheerfully. “I’ll swallow my theory whole—he may
        be right here beside you, for all either of us knows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
        I knew a chap who lived next door to his future
        wife and never guessed it until one summer he went
        abroad. He used to tell her all about his girls, too,
        and get her help and advice. Out on the ocean somewhere
        it came to him suddenly. Then he wanted to stop
        the boat! He came back on the next steamer. Fact!
        Fortunately his wire got in ahead of him, which gave
        her time to think things over. She was most surprised,
        but she had to acknowledge that he was right! They
        figured out that they had been in love a dozen years
        without once being aware of it. Frightful waste, eh?
        They’re the happiest couple I know.”</p>

    <p>They sat in silence for a moment or two, each thinking
        a separate train of thought.</p>

    <p>“Petruchio,” she turned to him quietly, “would you
        be so kind as to get out, put the check-rein back on ‘Ned’
        and ‘Sorry’, and then hop in and drive with me back to
        Padua?”</p>

    <p>“Ah, Kate!” he cried, springing out of the carriage.
        “Mad Kate, merry Kate, the daintiest Kate of all the
        Kates, and sometimes the curst, that right merrily
        I will.”</p>

    <p>On the way home he induced her to talk of Gorgas,
        and as an elder sister she entered readily into a discussion
        of her future education. She told of the child’s
        fondness for boyish sports. Did he know that Gorgas
        had won a huge silver cup in a tennis contest? Yes, indeed;
        she had carried it off matched against pretty stout
        boys. Quite a hoyden, she was. Of course, she was
        getting too old for that sort of thing now. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
        had to be done. She agreed that whatever it should
        be, it should be done gradually. The child must not be
        driven. So Blynn very adroitly filled Miss Keyser’s
        mind with the right attitude toward Gorgas. He was
        sure of having an ally in the work he had before him, and
        one that would not in his absence set up wrong family
        currents.</p>

    <p>Twilight was settling when they arrived home. From
        McAlley, stableman, errand-boy and gardener, he
        learned that Gorgas and “Gyp” had not come back.</p>

    <p>“She’ll be ’long soon,” McAlley remarked without
        concern. “Mebbe ‘Gyp’ is playin’ lame. He’s a
        scamp, that he is, a scamp.”</p>

    <p>Blynn could not share McAlley’s indifference. His
        heart beat horridly, and for no good reason that his
        mind could tell him. The family always dined late, and
        the household was run on a do-as-you-please system.
        Perhaps this child had been out at dusk many times before.
        All that he told himself; yet terrifying apprehension
        seized him.</p>

    <p>In fifteen minutes he was plunging down Cresheim
        Valley, now quite shadowy. Up the hill before him
        came a slow figure walking beside a horse. He dove into
        the bushes and watched her pass him. In the deceptive
        gloom she seemed to him again a self-possessed little
        woman. Far enough back he followed, within him the
        sickening relief that comes after sudden fear.</p>

    <p>“I’ll never get used to this,” he said to himself, as he
        lost sight of her in the dark, when she turned into her
        own lane. “If that lassie belonged to me I’d see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
        she’d come home in daylight. She has no idea of the
        risk she’s running.”</p>

    <p>He could not discern figures any longer, but he could
        make out McAlley’s lantern and could hear the voices.</p>

    <p>He was feeling quite peaceful until one-armed “Aurora,”
        the lamp-lighter, who always loped along half
        bent over, gave him a fright by suddenly bobbing
        around the corner and scuttling across the road to a
        crazy street-lamp.</p>

    <p class="drop-cap">THE opportunity of making the acquaintance of
        Bardek came sooner than Blynn had planned,
        and in a very natural manner.</p>

    <p>The instruction of the Williams boy was carried on
        almost entirely in the open air. That youngster could
        no more enjoy himself cooped up in a house than a bear-cub.
        The moment he entered the shadowy door of the
        school-house his spirits congealed and his mind began
        to slow up. The rooms of the “Hall” had been planned
        entirely for adults—so had the discipline—and
        rather slow-blooded adults at that. The temperature
        and the ventilation were exactly right for elderly ladies
        and gentlemen. And they talked to children about
        draughts! They might just as well have worried them
        about sclerosis of the arteries.</p>

    <p>In his adroit way Blynn had enticed the boy to play
        a “sort of game” with colloquial German. Call it a
        “game,” and the lad would play until he dropped;
        and by letting him shout at the top of his voice he was
        easily persuaded that it was not “study.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>In one of the wild paths in the Valley, where the
        sumac and the young poplar made a complete screen,
        Blynn and “Chuck” Williams, loudly reviewing German
        phrases, came upon a voice, rich and fine, carolling
        <i>deutsche Lieder</i>. It was quite near at hand among the
        tangle of blackberry vines and elderberry and came
        booming suddenly at them as if purposely to startle.
    </p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first">“Kuckuck! Kuckuck! Ruft aus dem Wald,</div>
            <div class="verse">Lasset uns singen; tanzen und springen,</div>
            <div class="verse">Frühling! Frühling! wird es nun bald!”</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It was the song of the cuckoo, which every German
        child knows from the cradle. While it is yet winter
        the tremulous bird catches premonitions in the air and
        sings its eager song of spring. “Let us dance and
        sing,” it cries to all the woods; “Come out! Come
        out, into the blooming fields and among the budding
        trees!” Carried away by its own urging desire it
        flies from its haunts searching for the Spring.</p>

    <p>The great voice softened and grew tenderly pathetic.
        Ah! brave little singer, your song is false, your throbbing
        heart has lied to you. Winter, stark, chilling
        winter is around you and within.</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first">“Kuckuck! Kuckuck! Treflicher Held</div>
            <div class="verse">Was du gesungen ist dir gelungen</div>
            <div class="verse">Winter! Winter! räumet das Feld.”</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At the end of the song the boy and the teacher applauded
        vigorously.</p>

    <p>“Bravo!” called Blynn. “Once more! <i>Encore!</i>”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>The bushes parted, disclosing the round face of
        Bardek.</p>

    <p>“Grüss Gott!” he greeted jovially. “Have I not
        now heard the German speech? Die süsse Sprache
        meines Vaterlands?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” rejoined the astonished Blynn; “you did
        hear us talking German, a sort of German.”</p>

    <p>“Och! it was a sort, yes,” the shoulders shrugged
        cynically; “but it was German, the speech of my country.”</p>

    <p>“But you are not German, are you?” persisted
        Blynn. “Yesterday you were—”</p>

    <p>“<i>Ach!</i> Must man be ever the same? Yesterday
        was I French; gut! Heute bin ich wirklich deutsch.
        Auch gut! Morgen, vielleicht, bin ich italienisch!
        <i>Hora è sempre!</i>”
    </p>

    <p>“What does he say?” inquired “Chuck.”</p>

    <p>“My good boy,” Bardek explained in clear English.
        “Yesterday I have been French. Good! It pleased
        me so to be. The day was French,” flourishing his
        hands about the sky, “quite French. Today it
        pleases me to be German. How could anyone be anything
        but German on a day like this?” waving again
        toward the thick, white clouds and indicating the cool
        Northern breeze. “<i>Ein tousand ein hunderd ein und
            zwanzig! Was!</i>... Now at this moment am I
        North-German; soon,” he squinted at a gathering darkness
        in the southwest, “I am becoming <i>Bayrischer</i>.
        It rains ever in München; <i>nicht wahr</i>? <i>Ach!</i>
        <i>München</i> is a heaven of earth—rain, rain, rain, warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
        <i>himmlischer</i> rain on the outside, and <i>bier, bier</i>, cool,
        <i>dunkels Löwenbraü</i> on the inside!”
    </p>

    <p>His voice was heavy and deep, the bass singing quality
        always present, and his intonation noticeably distinct
        like that of the book-read foreigner. He struck
        his consonants hard, as if he enjoyed them, especially
        the final t’s and s’s; his l’s trolled along the roof of
        his mouth; and he breathed his vowels sonorously.</p>

    <p>He laughed as he stepped into the path, and added,
        still addressing the boy,</p>

    <p>“When the sky is all of blue and pink, so am I
        Italian. My skin changes. I am then a new beast.
        Oh! It is good to change the skin and the mind. Boy,
        don’t you get sick to be always the American beast?”</p>

    <p>“Not on your tin-type!” “Chuck” spoke up
        promptly. “I don’t want to be a Dutchman. Rather
        be what I am. But it’s fun talking Dutch with Mr.
        Blynn.”</p>

    <p>“‘Not on your tin-type,’” echoed Bardek, eyes extended
        in mock surprise. “<i>Was für eine Sprache!</i>
        What a language!”</p>

    <p>Blynn explained. “A ‘tin-type’ is a cheap photograph.
        ‘Not on your tin-type’ is slang for—for,
        well, for ‘<i>Gar nichts.</i>’”</p>

    <p>“Not on his tin-type,” Bardek rolled his eyes, to the
        great amusement of “Chuck.” “<i>Nicht auf seiner
            Photographie!</i> It is the language for peddlers.”</p>

    <p>They chatted in mixed English and German for several
        minutes; at least, Bardek did; that is, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
        wasn’t singing, or teaching “Chuck” some good colloquial
        German.</p>

    <p>“Uh! <i>Schweinerei!</i>” he grunted in smiling disgust.
        “Chuck” had spat, American style, at a passing bee.
        “‘<i>Schweinerei</i>,’ my boy, means ‘piggy.’ But the pigs,
        they do not spit. Only the Americans spit. Everywhere
        in America is the sign, ‘Pray, do not spit <i>here</i>!’
        ‘Pray, do not spit <i>there</i>!’ <i>Ach, Schweinerei! Vierte
            Klasse!</i> That’s a good word for you, ‘<i>Vierte Klasse</i>!’
        I, I am of the <i>Vierte Klasse</i>, but I, I do not yet spit!”</p>

    <p>Blynn studied the man before him. The frank, open
        manner, the voluble utterance, the great healthy laughter
        stole into his prejudice and substituted liking.
        This is a chap one had to be friends with; yet Blynn
        knew that good fellows are not always harmless.
        There was something coarse about the man that repelled,
        the very thing, too, that attracted: his unspoken
        egoism, his quiet, outspoken self-satisfaction.
        Unconventionality beamed from him; too frequently,
        Blynn knew, a sign of selfishness. Would this fellow
        continue agreeable and jolly under provocation? It
        did not seem so. Or if his strong desires met with
        obstacle? Law, order, the rules of decent society, these
        he probably scoffed at; anything, indeed, that demanded
        restraint or curbing.</p>

    <p>“I tried to talk to you yesterday,” Blynn remarked,
        “but the horse wouldn’t have it.”</p>

    <p>“Yesterday?” Bardek raised his eyes in inquiry.
        “The horse would not?—<i>Ach!</i>” he roared, “you it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
        was who—Ho!” he laughed at the memory. “You
        say, ‘I cannot <i>under</i>stand’ and then you cannot <i>up</i>-stand!”
        Bardek imitated by a pretence of flopping
        to the ground at the syllable “stand.” “I see very
        well that you could not ‘stand.’ You could not but
        sit. And it was something hard, <i>nicht wahr</i>, when you
        did sit!”</p>

    <p>His laughter died out suddenly. “Wait,” he raised
        a hand. “It was the Miss Levering you were with?
        Yes? Excuse. I must see about something.” He
        really said, “Som’t’ing,” with just the suggestion of a
        studied “th,” but one could never indicate his speech
        phonetically. Sometimes, the “th” was clear, sometimes
        it was a “t,” sometimes a “z” or “d.” His
        English varied from right speech to a broken jargon,
        but always it was rich and clear. “Wait! I come
        back, <i>auf der Stelle</i>, in one moment.”</p>

    <p>The bushes closed in about him. It was as if he had
        vanished, a fat satyr of the woods.</p>

    <p>After a brief moment of silence his face appeared,
        and it was eloquent with welcome.</p>

    <p>“You will come into my cave in the woods?” he
        beckoned, spreading out the bushes with his high hobnailed
        boots. “It is not to everyone that I give the
        invitation. You have come well recommended—by
        your faces and your good talk. You talk German—Dutch,
        you called it, you little <i>Schweinerei</i>!—Dutch
        it is not. Dutch is good. I can Dutch, but—this is
        my German day. Today, I welcome you as compatriots.
        Tomorrow, br-r-r,” scowling beautifully at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
        “Chuck” Williams, “I may be French,” he glanced
        quizzically at the sky. “Then, you shall be my national
        enemy and I would—‘<i>Vive la belle France! A
            bas les All’mands!</i>’” he roared, making mimic charges
        at the delighted “Chuck.”</p>

    <p>They were tramping through the thicket as they
        talked, shouted, and pantomimed. In a few steps they
        came upon a cosy clearing.</p>

    <p>“<i>Wilkommen alle!</i> Sit down, please!” Bardek
        pointed to comfortable rocks.</p>

    <p>A small portable tent stretched out before them. At
        the side, smoke curled from a rock-oven, which was at
        the same time a tiny forge. Bowing before the visitors
        was an unkempt Frau. She looked forty at first
        glance; in a little while she seemed not more than
        twenty-five. Twenty was probably nearer her right
        age. In her arms nestled a rather overgrown youngster;
        tugging at her skirts was another.</p>

    <p>“My summer house; the lady of the summer house,”
        Bardek explained ironically. Then he looked expectantly
        toward the tent.</p>

    <p>“Bist du noch nicht fertig, mein Kindschen?” he
        called eagerly. “Now you can come out. Two gentlemen—<i>entschuldigen!</i>—one
        gentleman and one
        <i>Schweinerei</i> would make call! Komm’, Liebschen!”
    </p>

    <p>From within a familiar voice responded, but in German:
        “Just a minute, Bardek, please.... Now I
        am ready. <i>Können die Herr’n raten wer ich bin?</i>”</p>

    <p>“She would know,” translated Bardek, “if the gentlemen
        can guess who she is.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Without waiting for the guesses, he lifted the flap
        of the tent. Gorgas, enclosed head and body in a great
        green shawl, stepped calmly out and courtesied.</p>

    <p>“Gee! This is great!” “Chuck” found voice for
        his glee. “It’s a dandy ‘hunky.’” “Hunky” is a
        boy’s secret hiding place. “I had a tent, once. Let’s
        have a tent out here, too, Mr. Blynn. We can live
        here and cook,” his greedy eye was devouring the perfect
        stone oven, “and study ’rithm’tic and things.
        Can’t we?”</p>

    <p>The boy took Gorgas as a matter of course. She
        was thirteen and a girl; he was eleven and a boy—those
        differences represent leagues.</p>

    <p>“I heard all you said,” Gorgas informed Blynn.
        “We often hear people going by on that path. Your
        German started Bardek after you. This is his German
        day. We—”</p>

    <p>“Chuck” was examining things, with Bardek at his
        side explaining volubly.</p>

    <p>“Do you speak German, too?” Blynn asked incredulously.</p>

    <p>“Nur ein wenig,” she replied modestly, but her fine
        tones told much. “Besser sprech’ ich fransösisch und
        italienisch. Ich versteh’—I understand German, but
        much better than I speak it. The ‘German days’
        don’t come as often as the French days. Bardek is
        all German today. Listen to him. His English gets
        German twists in it today.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

    <p>“Why, it’s quite jolly here.” Blynn seated himself
        on a comfortable stone, and assumed the air of a man
        who had done this sort of thing every day. “It’s quite
        a ‘hunky,’ as ‘Chuck’ would call it. I’d like to live
        this way myself. What man wouldn’t?”</p>

    <p>“I’m so glad you like it,” Gorgas whispered. She
        leaned over and rested her arm on his knee. “Chuck”
        and Bardek were inside the tent. The wife was grinning
        at the strangers and singing a gentle lullaby.
        “We have fine times here. You’re the first person to
        come by on that path for over a week. We sing and
        talk languages and Bardek tells stories of his travels.
        He has been all over the world. Some of them are
        whoppers,” she dropped her voice still lower, “but you
        can tell by his eyes that he is making them up. And
        we—oh, wait till I show you my latest.”</p>

    <p>She darted into the tent and returned with a disk
        of hammered copper, a dinner-plate, partly inlaid along
        the entire edge with a delicate silver tracery of a
        strange Byzantine design. “The holes had to be all
        cut out, and the silver filed and fitted. It must exactly
        fit, you know, exactly. Bardek scolds if it isn’t right
        to a millionth of an inch. It looks almost finished, but
        there are hours of pounding yet.”</p>

    <p>“What is it when it is cooked?” he asked, but his
        tone showed his delight with the workmanship.</p>

    <p>“Most anything—a cake plate, a serving tray, a
        card receiver, a fruit holder—lots of things. But,
        isn’t it beautiful! Bardek made the design. I couldn’t
        do that; but I did all the hammering and annealing
        and filed all the silver. Bardek says he may not throw
        this one away.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“It’s a beauty!” admitted Blynn. “A jim-dandy!
        By George, Gorgas, I certainly do admire this. But
        how will you ever take it home?”</p>

    <p>The shadow of disappointment rested for a moment
        on her face; then she seemed to shake it off resolutely.</p>

    <p>“He will sell it. It is only practice for me. I am
        learning. He uses it to teach me hammer strokes. I
        made the Varri stroke on that,” pointing proudly to
        the hundreds of soft hammer marks, “with the big
        hammer. It is not so heavy when you learn how to
        swing it. If I ever get to know how—well, I’ll have
        it in me; no one can take it away. Then I can make
        beautiful things wherever I am.... It is mean to
        have to sell things, though—give them to people you
        never see.”</p>

    <p>“Yes, indeed,” he touched her hand lightly in understanding.
        “I know just how you feel.”</p>

    <p>“So!” Bardek pounced upon them. “You are
        showing it off, eh? It is good; very, very good.” He
        said “vairy,” but this word, like others of his English
        vocabulary, had many pronunciations. “I am vairy
        proud of my pupil. Gorgas—” he emphasized the
        last syllable as if it were Gorgasse—“Gorgas is a
        golden child. She has gifts. You will see, some day.
        I have put some of my art into her. That!—the little
        marks there!—is harder than it looks! It is the
        stroke of the best workman and the biggest miser in
        Milan, G’sepp’ G’ovan’ Varri. I stole it from him.
        Ho! I go to him and say, ‘Please, Messer G’sepp’
        G’ovan’ Varri, I am poor, I will carry charcoal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
        blow your fire and sweep your place and make the beds
        and cook you good macaroni and cut up cheeses, if you
        will but give me a place to sleep.’</p>

    <p>“G’sepp’ G’ovan’ Varri, he storm and curse; say he
        have no room for beggars, and that he will not pay, he
        will not pay; but his ugly eye watch me and then he
        say, ‘Blow that fire, you—’ I will not say what he
        have said I am. On my honor, gentlemen and ladies,”
        saluting, “I am not that thing that G’sepp’ G’ovan’
        Varri say I have been.</p>

    <p>“<i>Ach, Himmelreiche!</i> How I work! I sweat and
        pull and dig and carry and—<i>I watch</i>! Tip, tip,
        tappy, tappy, tap—oh, so soft he play music by his
        hammer, the great hammer he make those soft touches.
        And he fires much, burns and hammers, burns and hammers.
        In two day I try, and he near catch me. In
        t’ree day I say, ‘Goodby, G’sepp’ G’ovan’ Varri!
        Your bed, it is too hard. I will just—skeedaddle!
        and take with me, oh, yes, jus’ a leetle somet’ing of a
        idea in my head.</p>

    <p>“Before I leave I make a little gift of farewell: I
        make his secret strokes and it comes out a design, a
        great goose, and the taps on the wings spell ‘Varri.’</p>

    <p>“And now the beautiful Gorgas—I give it to her
        for what I pay G’sepp’ G’ovan’ Varri, which is t’
        gr-r-eat not’ing. If I stole it, well—der Hehler ist
        so gut wie der Stehler: the second thief is cousin
        to t’ first thief.... Ah! she do good! Vairy, vairy
        good!” He held the work up and admired it. “Es
        gibt nicht schöneres, nicht wahr, Kindschen?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Oh, it could be better,” protested Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“<i>Wass hör’ ich?</i>” he affected great sternness.
        “<i>Englisch? Sprich’ Deutsch, bitte!</i> Look at the
        heavens; it is today the heavens of Deutschland.
        Sprich’ nur Deutsch, bitte!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, not German now, Bardek,” she laughingly
        begged. “Not before Mr. Blynn and ‘Chuck.’ I
        couldn’t.”</p>

    <p>“<i>So scheu!</i>” murmured Bardek admiringly. “So
        shy and innocent. All right. We take holiday. We
        leave Deutschland for America and English. But,”
        sadly, “it is t’ one language I do not speak. Only in
        English am I foreigner.”</p>

    <p>“Not at all,” protested Blynn. “Your English is
        splendid.”</p>

    <p>“Ah!” the flattery touched home. “You are good
        to say it. But I know. In Europe I am in my home
        in every land. The Bohemian knows all speeches.
        They have the gift, as you would know many songs,
        glad ones and sorrowful. When we are still young we
        go to countries; it comes to us. But ah! I did go
        to England never; only by books did I know English,
        and look! Bah! I feel I must spit, like my little
        Schweinerei here. Books! They tell all lies. In
        France, in Germany, in Holland, in Hungary, in Italy,
        they would know me for compatriot. In America I
        am a barbarian, a pagan, a ‘Gypsy,’ a ‘Dago.’ Ach!
        English? Ich hab’ eine schlechte Aussprache. I
        know! I know!”</p>

    <p>For an hour they debated genially. Before the meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
        broke up Bardek dropped on the ground, stretched
        out full length, propped his head up with one hand, and
        lapsed into silence. Questions brought only short answers.</p>

    <p>“It is time to go,” whispered Gorgas. “When he
        gets tired of people, he lets them know. Don’t talk to
        him any more; he has worn himself out with excitement.”</p>

    <p>Gorgas led the way through overhanging branches
        without a word. “Chuck” followed. Blynn sought to
        soften the abrupt exodus by a simple wave of the hand
        before he bent low to avoid the briars.</p>

    <p>“Kom’ bald wieder,” Bardek grunted. “Sobald als
        möglich. Come vairy soon again!” It was a sincere
        invitation, Gorgas assured them—Bardek was always
        himself—and it was a great tribute.</p>

            LIBERTÉ, EGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THEY did come soon again. The air was
        gently from the southwest. There was a
        blue summer sky with high lazy clouds.</p>

    <p>“Entrez, m’sieurs, mam’zelle!” called Bardek, and
        rattled on. “Je suis enchanté de vous voir! I am
        delighted to see you! Ah! when you were here last,
        the weather was gloomy and German—but today!
        Today the sky is beautiful and French. <i>Voici!</i>”
        spreading his hands to the heavens, “<i>Voici, la France!</i>”</p>

    <p>“Hang up your hat on the hall-rack,” he went on
        gayly in French. “I am ravished to see you! <i>Comment
            ça va</i>, Chucks?”</p>

    <p>Chucks grinned his lack of comprehension.</p>

    <p>“<i>Comment ça va</i>, Chucks?” Bardek extended a hand
        of greeting. “Can you not speak, Chucks?” he
        dropped into English. “Can you only spit, eh?
        <i>Pfui!</i> ‘<i>Comment ça va?</i>’ my Chucks, it is ‘Howd’y.’
        But have care! <i>Prends attention!</i> Pray do not spit.
        <i>Ici c’est defendu!</i> Here,” sweeping his hand in a short
        circle, “here it is beautiful France and here it is not
        permitted. Are you yet German, Chucks? Must I
        fight you?” he crooked an imaginary gun and stood
        ready to charge bayonets. His eyes glared; his bushy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
        eyebrows quivered; his whole body strained for the
        word of command. “<i>Conspuez les All’mands!</i>” he
        muttered as only the French could think that phrase.
        In a second all that ferocity had vanished. “<i>Non?</i>
        You have not yet changed your skin? <i>Eh bien!</i> We
        shall keep <i>l’entente cordiale</i>. <i>Vive l’Amérique!</i> I shake
        the hand.”
    </p>

    <p>“Chuck” and Bardek extended hands and wrung an
        international grip.</p>

    <p>“Et mam’zelle?” he turned to Gorgas. “Que veutelle
        faire aujourd’ hui? Sit and talk, <i>hein</i>?”</p>

    <p>“Let me work on my plate, Bardek,” she asked.
        “I’m excited about that plate.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Comment!</i>” he bristled at her English. “The sky,
        it is all of French! Aujourd’hui,” flourishing terribly
        at the sky, “il s’agit de parler français!”</p>

    <p>“Please, Bardek!” she begged. “Not French now;
        after while; not now. Please!”</p>

    <p>“Comme tu voudras, petite,” he gave in finally.
        “She will not speak the French, which she speak like—oh!—like
        heaven. C’est très curieux! She is afraid,
        Mr. Blynn, that you be critic. Ho!” laughed Bardek
        frankly. “She need have not the fear. <i>Pssst!</i> Mr.
        Blynn, he can have no language but the English. And
        even so, the little English of a little town,” pointing
        off toward the village, “a little town which goes to
        sleep on Sundays. It is too late for him. Language,
        it comes to children when their ears are open wide to
        hear the voice of things. When we grow old, sixteen,
        twenty, thirty—<i>malheureusement! Peau du diable!</i>—it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
        is too late. The bones in the head, they go thick.
        So with all things—after fourteen, fifteen, the mind
        <i>est fermé</i>, closed, shut up tight.”
    </p>

    <p>Gorgas was searching in the tent for her materials.</p>

    <p>“So, I take this child when she <i>is</i> child and teach
        her. You are professor, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>? Oh! You have
        my great admiration! You are—<i>pardon!</i>—so great
        a fool! You think you can teach old men and old girls
        who go to the university? How that is comic!
        Wooden-heads, they mumble words; they can repeat
        what you say, yes; but they can never <i>do</i>. To <i>do</i>, one
        must begin in the cradle. You would be contortionist,
        juggler, gymnast? Very well, wait until you are twenty-five!
        Sh! <i>Non!</i> You laugh? Zen why you try
        to teach old men of twenty how to think? It is a great
        fooling.... Oh, well,” he shrugged, “zey zink,” he
        stopped and tried again, “t’hey t’hink they do great
        zings—t’ings—<i>bla!</i>” he made a wry face. “I cannot
        say zat ‘th.’ It is one language for those who
        stutter, the English.”</p>

    <p>Bardek was all French on that day. One could almost
        believe that he had really changed his skin. He
        seemed sleeker, cleaner, even thinner; and the great
        mustachios had a glisten to them and a slight waxiness
        in the ends. His bearing was more courteous and considerate
        than on the “Deutschertag.” A gay kerchief
        adorned his neck and his turkey-feather had a jaunty
        tilt. Even his English had the very flavor of French
        idiom and French accent.</p>

    <p>While he talked Gorgas brought her plate to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
        stone, set up a lead block, and began to swing a rather
        large coppersmith’s hammer. She barely touched the
        metal as she beat rhythmically back and forth; the
        weight of the hammer seemed to disappear, so cleverly
        did she keep it moving.</p>

    <p>“<i>V’là!</i>” pointed Bardek. “That is the stroke of
        G’sepp’ G’ovan’ Varri. <i>Parfaitment!</i> <i>C’est bon!</i>
        ‘Tap, tap, tippity, tippity, tap, tap!’ It is music, is
        it not, <i>m’sieur</i>? She has the delicate muscle for that
        work. Two year, three year? <i>Non!</i> She will soon
        set—be woman and marry and have hundred t’ousand
        children. Ho!—”</p>

    <p>Gorgas looked up at him in grave rebuke.</p>

    <p>“Ho! see how she goes red and charming! The little
        maggots are running in her brain and making to wake
        all kind of wonder things and then—poof!—the
        school is done and life commence.”</p>

    <p>“Chuck” was at her side watching seriously. He
        plied her with questions, eager to imitate and, boy-like,
        quite confident he could do as well.</p>

    <p>“You must have known Gorgas for a long time,”
        Blynn began. “That work of hers is really wonderful.
        How did you find her?”</p>

    <p>Bardek squatted on the ground, produced a file, and
        began to smooth off bits of sheet silver. He glanced
        up at Blynn through crinkling eyes.</p>

    <p>“You look so stupid,” Bardek threw back his head;
        “and it is right. You do not know yet how much it is
        I know. You do it well, the look of the fool. Good!
        Gorgas has taken you for a friend. It is well that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
        play fool for her, speak for her, be dumb for her and
        if it need, lie for her, make ‘whoppers,’ as she calls
        t’em, for her. I like you for that, my friend.</p>

    <p>“You would know how she came? Well, she jus’—came.
        Three year ago she ride by on ‘Gyp’ and I say
        ‘H’lo, missy,’ and she say, ‘What are you doing?’ and
        I say ‘I make beauty’ and show her something, a small
        vase, all of gold and copper. Her eye grow big, so!
        and she draw back and say, ‘Are you a gypsy?’ and
        I say, ‘<i>Non! non! non!</i> T’ousand times <i>non!</i> I am a
        Bohemian.’ And she get off her horse, tie him to a
        tree and say, ‘Then may I come with you and will you
        show me how to make beauty?’</p>

    <p>“Zat is all, my friend, and she have been making
        beauty all the time. She herself makes beauty,” he
        looked back at her tenderly, “wherever she go. She
        is always serious, always in great thinking. Zey are
        ze most beautiful children, the quiet ones. Gigglers?
        Bah! Comics? Zey are ordinairy. Her eyes they always
        look at you like they were so old! <i>Elle est très
            sympathique</i>, my good friend.</p>

    <p>“She learn—ah, how she learn!—<i>vite!</i> <i>Comme
            ça!</i>” he snapped his fingers. “She take languages like
        the singing sparrow drinks at spring water. She would
        be Bohemian perhaps; her grandfather or grandmother—who
        knows? In America everybody must come from
        Europe! See her brown face and black hair? Ah!
        that is often seen in my country. It is oriental.”</p>

    <p>He stopped talking to gaze at her at work.</p>

    <p>Blynn took the chance to tell of many things. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
        sketched in the mother and the Levering household. He
        told of schools and all the business of bringing up young
        girls to be gay, delicate do-nothings until some man
        should be attracted by their frailty and marry them.</p>

    <p>Bardek exploded many times. His theories of education
        for girls were not the prevailing ones in America.
        Everybody should learn to work, he believed. The
        highest trade of all is that of a maker of beauty. Those
        few who can, should have material, tools and infinite
        leisure. They were the only aristocrats; and among
        them there should be no fakirs. The university doctor
        may be a fool; he usually is a fool, averred Bardek; but
        no one cares; he can do little harm. But with things
        of beauty there should be no such trifling. Learning
        was no great matter; no scholar has learning enough
        to reconstruct the broken wing of a beetle; the world
        wags very well when learning is asleep. But beauty is
        important; one must choose ever between beauty and
        death.</p>

    <p>Those who could not minister to the esthetic needs
        should take their turn at the fetching, lifting and carrying,
        the portering of life. That is their happiness,
        their beauty.</p>

    <p>“Look at my wife,” he illustrated, nudging toward
        the tent. “She has not the skill, the art. Good!
        But she work, and carry a pack, and do everything
        right for the babies; and she is happy, working, working,
        working all the day. When she work and I work,
        we sing songs of Hungary where she live. That is fine.
        Woman must not be waxworks! <i>Sapristi!</i> The good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
        Lord has give them a job, my friend. <i>Nom d’une
            pipe!</i>” he sighed softly. “A big job! It needs zat
        zey get ready for it.”</p>

    <p>In the spaces between Bardek’s speeches Blynn tried
        to hint of the trouble that would come to Gorgas if it
        were known at home how she had spent her time off in
        the Cresheim woods.</p>

    <p>Bardek was not concerned; when a man is right he
        does not worry his head about what others will think.
        If he had bothered himself over the opinions of small
        minds he would have stayed in Hungary and sold tobacco
        and postage stamps. No! Liberty is worth
        paying much for; and when there is fear of criticism,
        liberty is dead.</p>

    <p>Bah! The fat mother would not know a golden child
        from a <i>salade de tomate</i>. Doubtless she would scold a
        little. His wife, she scolds. It is nothing; it passes
        off and away like steam in the air. What one has, one
        has; all the scoldings of all the little people in the world
        cannot alter it; on earth there is no judge but oneself.</p>

    <p>“Already,” he said, “the little Gorgas has more
        than all those copy-kittens who went to school and sat
        at wooden desks in the dark little rooms and listened as
        nice old ladies tell how to be jus’ waxworks. In her
        arm, in the ends of all her fingers, in her eye and on her
        tongue and in her brain, too, she has beauty, and the
        power to make beauty.</p>

    <p>“You, you, my friend, have studied in the university.
        Try it out with the little Gorgas. What do you
        know that she does not know better? Do you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
        better how high is heaven and how wide are the angels’
        wings? You have studied languages, and you know
        German—a sort of German, ho!—and French and
        Italian, perhaps; and you will always be foreigner there
        and a fool: but she, the little Gorgas that I teach, she
        <i>is</i> German and she <i>is</i> French and she <i>is</i> Italian.”
    </p>

    <p>He stopped his work for a moment to show her how
        to smooth off the inlay without disturbing the fine surface
        of the beaten copper.</p>

    <p>“Let us sing for them, my pretty one,” he coaxed
        in French. “You are some of the beauty that I have
        made. I want to show you off, exhibit you, prove my
        skill. What shall it be?” He ran through several
        simple songs of childhood. Reluctantly she agreed,
        only to please him as he knew, and together they sang
        a lively air. It was about life on the winding roads,
        and there was a chorus of jolly tappings which they did
        lightly with their hammers.</p>

    <p>“That is liberty,” Bardek commented. “In France
        they have not liberty except painted on every sign-post.
        ‘<i>Liberté, fraternité, equalité!</i>’ <i>Là, là, là, là, là!</i> It
        is the great national joke! America? <i>Non!</i> ‘The
        land of the brave,’” he sang nasally in burlesque, “‘and
        the ho-o-me of the fre-e-e!’ Ho! that is vairy, vairy
        comic.” He wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes.
        “Very comic! I come to the land of liberty, ‘the
        ho-o-me of the free’ and I cannot sell my work without
        I get a permit for which I must pay; and in each spot
        I must have new one. I cannot live as I please. The
        people say, ‘<i>Phieu!</i> go away, ugly man. You have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
        soul, for you have no stiff white collar. Tie up the
        neck with white peekadilly and we give you liberty to
        live by us!’ I have not liberty to drink my beer or
        smoke when I please.</p>

    <p>“And Miss Gorgas, she cannot learn to make beautiful
        things. She cannot tell her mother she come to me.
        She must sneak like a thief and lie. It is not good, that
        kind of liberty. Liberty is a great thing, my friend.
        You all go mad and have red-fire and elections and
        speeches and big ugly bands and Mr. Cleveland is made
        president, and <i>hélas!</i> millions of free Americans weep,
        weep, weep zet zeh must have Mr. Cleveland for president.
        America is not the land of liberty. It is the
        land of prohibition, yes; sobriety, yes; uniformity, yes;
        but here is not liberty. Of all peoples in Mount Airy
        only I perhaps have liberty. You would not want to
        live like me, eh? You look at me. <i>Zut!</i> I read you
        mind. You say, ‘Not on your tin-type!’ Then you
        do not much care for liberty.”</p>

    <p>Many such days the little group had together. German
        days, French days, Italian days came in regular
        succession. “Chuck” disputed with him about the
        days, and Bardek took great joy in his wordy battles
        over the sort of weather that prevailed. To all but
        “Chuck” it was quite evident that his succession of
        days was a transparent device to give Gorgas constant
        exercise in the fluent, living language; but save for the
        laughing eyes and occasional wink, he stoutly stood for
        the theory that the weather made his skin change.
        Bohemians, he claimed, belonged to no country and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
        every country and were doomed all their lives to slip
        back and forth through various national personalities.
        The weather did it.</p>

    <p>“You have only one country!” he told “Chuck”
        scornfully. “How sorry I am for you! So you hooray
        for the stars and stripes, and you make the grand
        racket on the Fourt’ of July, an’ you rage at Sout’
        America, and Europe, an’ all the other little peoples.
        Poof!” he blew himself up into his own notion of the
        spread-eagle American orator. “You could fight the
        whole wor-r-ld, wit’ hands tied behind the back—and
        the whole wor-r-ld would laugh in zere sleeve, and make
        such pictures in the comic papers, about which you
        would know nothing. Oh, how sorry I am for you,
        Chucks, who have only one country, when I, Bardek,
        have so many! In France I sing the Marseillaise on
        the fourteen of July; in Germany I celebrate the eighteen
        of January, the birthday of the Empire; and in
        Poland, on the twelve of September, I drink to Sobieski,
        who saved Poland from the Turk—an’ at no time do
        I rage, and make boasts at any country. You are
        proud of only one land, Chucks; I, Bardek, am homesick
        for all the wor-r-ld!”</p>

    <p>One day when they went back through the hidden
        path and under the arch of briers into the enclosure,
        not a vestige of Bardek and his belongings remained.</p>

    <p>“He will come back when he wishes to be here again,”
        Gorgas explained, with just a shade of disappointment.
        But she did not wholly conceal her gratification.
        Lately she had been feeling terribly guilty over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
        clandestine meetings with the Bohemian. She could
        date the beginning of her worry over the matter. It
        had come suddenly in the night when she awoke trembling
        and weeping over she knew not what. Fires
        burned in her, and she discovered an intense longing to
        give up what had been heretofore the most helpful experience
        in her life: her solitude, her freedom from the
        necessity of communicating. Now she cried out for a
        brother or a sister or a mother to whom she could tell
        everything, even trivial things. Until now she had
        fared alone, self-sufficient as a tree, and had never
        spoken to anyone, even to Bardek, of what meant most
        to her. On this night, as she lay awake, she reveled in
        the despairs of loneliness.</p>

    <p>At about that time Blynn had appeared and had satisfied
        her need. To him she had unburdened, and
        had come away pure and heightened as after confession.</p>

    <p>All this had made her self-conscious in her visits to
        Bardek. He had remarked the change in her, and
        talked about it, as was his way; which made her, somehow,
        ashamed. When her cheeks flamed under his persistent
        candor, he would call to his wife in great delight.
        In some Hungarian dialect he would invite her
        to look at the bud bursting; the little, green leaves
        unfolding; the fresh, sweet petals stretching themselves.
        There never was any doubt as to his meaning.</p>

    <p>After that when Gorgas parted the elder branches
        and looked into his bower she came with the face of a
        child-woman, full of subtle new dignity, an unstudied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
        preoccupation, as if the mind within were very, very
        busy on its great affairs.</p>

    <p>And guilt seized her, without giving a single reason.
        “It is wrong!” sang a humming in her ears. “What
        is wrong?” she would ask herself wildly. “It is
        wrong! It is wrong!” the voices would cry; and no
        one could tell her <i>what</i> was wrong.</p>

    <p>With Blynn beside her she looked steadily at the
        blanched circle left by the tent.</p>

    <p>“Well!” she gave a deep, healthy exhalation, and
        stepped back into the narrow path. “I’m both sorry
        and glad. I don’t know why I should be glad; but I
        am. It is all mixed—m-mixed u-up.” Her lips
        quivered though her eyes smiled gamely. “I don’t
        know whether I am going to cry or laugh.”</p>

    <p>“Shall I toss a coin?” Blynn inquired.</p>

    <p>“Chuck” was examining the “hunky” and speculating
        upon moving in as soon as he could wheedle a tent
        out of his father. Blynn and Gorgas stood close
        together facing each other in the path. Her eyes
        searched his steadily until they slowly brimmed and
        shut out all view.</p>

    <p>“I guess I’m mo-mostly g-glad!” she put out her
        hands toward him and lightly touched his sleeve.</p>

    <p>“If you cry now,” whispered the man, “you’ll splash
        me awfully. Let’s wait till we have more room.”</p>

    <p>That decided the matter. It was a hearty burst of
        girlish laughter which cleared the air like the proverbial
        thunder. All the way home they sang and danced and
        played “tag” and raced.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“When will Bardek be back?” Blynn asked before
        he bade the children goodby.</p>

    <p>“Perhaps next week; perhaps next month,” Gorgas
        conjectured. “Once he stayed away two months. Oh,
        he’ll be along again soon. <i>A tout à l’heure, m’sieu’</i>.”
        She stepped gaily up the walk toward her own door.
        “<i>Auf wiedersehen und -hören und -sprechen.</i> Until
        I see you and hear you and speak you again!”</p>

    <p>Yet the month passed away, and another month and
        many months, but Cresheim Valley saw no trace of
        Bardek.</p>

    <p>Along in November the mails brought a carefully
        wrapped package containing eighty-two dollars and six
        cents. A note in French said simply:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“It was a robber who bought your plate, but I will
            not ask too much for the art which I stole from Varri.
            I do penance by taking so little. The miser! For my
            silver and copper I charge you a trifle—which I have
            taken out. What is here is yours—well earned,
            golden child.</p>

        <p>“Until we meet and talk again,</p>

        <p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bardek</span>.”</p>
    </div>

    <p>After a conference with Mr. Blynn, Gorgas forwarded
        the package anonymously to the treasurer of
        the Children’s Aid Society.</p>

    <p>“It is an offering to propitiate the theft from G’sepp’
        G’ovan’ Varri,” said Blynn; “let us hope it will count
        as a mass for the peace of Varri’s penurious soul.”</p>

        <h3 class="nobreak">VII<br>

            A “FRENCH DAY” AT NIGHT</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">MRS. LEVERING did not mean to neglect her
        children; but her life was busy with the running
        of a big household, and with the claims
        of neighbors, the church, and charitable organizations.
        In her home life she was delightfully lax and unsystematic;
        but it was liberty for all, not a bad arrangement
        for domestic happiness, when it works.</p>

    <p>Her two children had come along without making
        much demand upon her. If they had been frail or
        sickly she would have been the promptest of nurses, and
        perhaps she would have learned more about them; but
        they grew along sturdily without so much as a single
        call for help. As a result they instinctively repelled
        coddling. There were no effusive greetings between
        mother and daughter, no kissings at night time, and
        only the most casual peck at lengthy partings. It was
        a very sensible and practical environment; and, on the
        whole, satisfactory to the Levering family.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering treated her daughters as if they were
        her own age. There was no “baby-talk” at any stage
        of their upbringing. Nearly everything was discussed
        openly, but that did not mean that the children had a
        vote in everything. Unconventional as the mother was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
        in most things, she threw about the children a protective
        ring of unwritten rules, over which there was no debate—almost
        the same code that her own mother had used.
        Gorgas could fight against going to school and win.
        School was an expense, anyway; and Gorgas seemed to
        be doing very well by herself with such help as the
        mother fancied Keyser was giving her; and many children
        managed pretty well with a tutor or two. But
        acquaintances, especially male, were scrutinized and limited;
        late night prowlings were forbidden; there was no
        latch-key for any save the master-of-the-house—who
        never went out!—and all letters, outgoing and incoming,
        must pass inspection.</p>

    <p>So, you see, Mrs. Levering had no tingle of conscience
        concerning her children; on the contrary, she had many
        exalted moments at the thought of all her prohibitory
        care over them.</p>

    <p>Allen Blynn was O. K.’d as a matter of course.
        Everyone knew all about him. He was an honor man
        at college; his mother was of “good people,” descendants
        of somebody or other; and he was of the faculty
        of the University. Of course, his manners were right—he
        used a fork properly; he was charmingly considerate
        of ladies; children liked him; and he had a good,
        honest face; but the other qualifications, the college
        honors and the university degrees really made him
        “moral,” and therefore a free and unrestricted companion
        of her two girls. Besides, the mother was
        thrifty enough to see the advantage of securing so excellent
        and so inexpensive a tutor for Gorgas.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>On the days when he and Gorgas studied together it
        grew to be the custom for the tutor to stay on for the
        informal family dinner, to get his “pay,” as he had
        bargained, of good food and good company. They
        were jolly affairs, full of gay chatter and serious discussion
        of men and things. Blynn radiated on these
        occasions, for the dinner was his natural habitat. On
        the tennis-courts he was an indifferent actor; but whenever
        the game was speech, he scored masterfully.</p>

    <p>Guests seemed to drop in fortuitously on these evenings,
        while the dinner grew imperceptibly more elaborate.
        With a daughter aged twenty-two, Mrs. Levering’s
        instincts told her when to entertain young people,
        and Miss Keyser Levering was a more modern mental
        replica of her mother. Edwin Morris, the university
        tennis champion, still in his late ’teens, was a frequent
        visitor, as were “Sam” Davis, the “law-man”; Keyser’s
        chums, Mary Weston and Betty Sommers; Diccon, a
        newspaper-man, and a collegian of Blynn’s time; and
        Leopold, a distinguished-looking young English Jew, of
        the science department of the University.</p>

    <p>Others came and went, but these gradually drifted
        together to form the core of a little social group.</p>

    <p>On these occasions Gorgas seemed to disappear. She
        shrank visibly into the rôle of little girl invited to look
        on. Her animated and accomplished sister overpowered
        her and made her a speechless dependent. All the
        gaucheries of childhood came out to daunt her. She
        stumbled against things, spilled her salt, and walked
        about with ox-like grace. One mild, reproving look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
        from her sister would make her trebly clumsy for the
        evening.</p>

    <p>Blynn tried often to bring her out, but it only increased
        her seeming stupidity. After all, she was a
        child, he reminded himself, but not without puzzled
        memories of the strange age she could put on when they
        were alone together.</p>

    <p>Keyser, whom Blynn had rechristened “Kate,”—a
        name which everyone took up—was so charmingly at
        ease that in spite of his desire to befriend the little
        sister, he found his talk gravitating toward the elder.</p>

    <p>And Gorgas was really content to look on, to listen
        and, above all, to remain completely unnoticed. She
        did not always succeed, much to her public confusion.
        With Morris, the tennis boy, she was more comfortable,
        save when he tried to draw her out into the circle.
        This he discovered early he must not do; so he contrived
        to sit beside her and tell her about his college
        pranks in undertones. When he discovered that she
        played tennis and had won the Junior cup, he took her
        in charge forthwith; and on other days met her on the
        courts and gave her an exceptional practice. Their
        “doubles” combination soon grew to be practically unbeatable.</p>

    <p>One evening the conversation drifted to the culture-war
        over Latin and Greek. Blynn was trying to show
        how the absorption in these studies, which rarely got
        beyond the veriest elements, was keeping our generation
        from the marvelous literatures of Europe. Centuries
        from now, he claimed, the modern languages would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
        looked upon as even more classical than the ancients.</p>

    <p>“I am handicapped in my work,” he admitted, “because
        I do not know Danish, Swedish, Spanish, Italian,
        German, and French; I mean, really know them. A
        school child in any country of Europe would laugh at
        my attempts to speak or read the languages. No one
        ever hinted to me what were the real tools of scholarship.”</p>

    <p>Leopold told of his classical training under tutors
        in England. He had begun to read Latin at eight,
        added Greek at nine, and he could not remember when
        he was unable to understand French and German.</p>

    <p>“America is giving up foreign languages,” Leopold
        summed up. “The students will not put the time on
        them.”</p>

    <p>“But I know they will,” Blynn returned firmly, “if
        the thing is taught reasonably. You began at eight
        and nine, Leopold; well, that’s the age to do it.”</p>

    <p>The conversation threatened to become pedagogic
        and heavy, but the girls were interested, too. Mary
        Weston told of some phenomenal pianists who had been
        developed in just that way.</p>

    <p>“The teacher told me she took them young, four to
        five years; visited them every day. There was no hateful
        ‘practice.’ ‘Mar-y! have you done your scales
        today?’ ‘No-m.’ ‘Then come right in this minute
        and do them!’ I can hear my mother calling me yet.
        Result: ‘Chapel in the Mountains’ with the left hand
        over,” she illustrated comically on the table, “‘Dum,
        dum, <i>dum</i>, twinkle-innkle-ink!’ That’s almost my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
        repertoire.... This teacher got her youngsters over
        every difficulty without a single growl. Master Stewardson—you
        heard him, Kate,”—everyone had
        adopted Blynn’s “Kate”—“at the Willings’—he’s
        one of them. Wasn’t he slick?”</p>

    <p>Mary drew an imaginary bow across her arm and
        whined the opening of the “Spring Song.”</p>

    <p>“Bravo!” applauded Leopold, “that’s bully, you
        know. Sounds just like a violin—one with a bad
        throat.”</p>

    <p>“I thought she fingered well,” added Davis.</p>

    <p>Diccon insisted that he heard an open string. He
        always abominated the open string.</p>

    <p>A burst of imitators overtook the table, violins,
        flageolets, bassoons, bass-viols. Morris took the prize
        with the sextette from “Lucia” as done by Sousa on a
        half-dozen interrupting muted trombones.</p>

    <p>“All of which proves,” summed up Betty Sommers,
        when the fun had died down, “that none of us knows
        music.”</p>

    <p>Davis, the law-man, protested—he had been a growling
        bass-viol: “Don’t say that. We have merely cultivated
        virtuosity at the expense of—”</p>

    <p>“Skill,” “Music,” “Everything,” he was helped out.</p>

    <p>“At the expense of—I demand the floor, Madam
        Chairman—at the expense of—”</p>

    <p>“Our neighbors,” Gorgas put in quietly.</p>

    <p>“Good!” cried Davis. “Amendment accepted.
        Ah! Somnolent and suspicious Mount Airy! This;
        night’s joy will be chronicled as dissipation, and tongues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
        will wag. Here’s to our neighbors,” and he tossed off a
        handful of salted almonds.</p>

    <p>“We don’t know music,” insisted Blynn, his mind
        not at all diverted by the clamor; “and we don’t know
        anything.”</p>

    <p>“I arise to protest,” Mary Weston appealed to Mrs.
        Levering. “This male professor has cast aspersions
        upon the expensive education we girls have achieved via
        the instruction imparted at the ‘Misses Warren’s Select
        French and English School for Young Ladies.’”</p>

    <p>Laughter from the girls showed how much they valued
        this expensive training.</p>

    <p>“If I had a catalog here,” Mary persisted, “I could
        prove to you how thoroughly well we were brung up.
        ‘You must nevah say, “raised,” my deah young lady,’”
        Mary was in full swing imitating the elder Miss Warren.
        “‘Beets are “raised”; turnips and cabbages
        are “raised”; young ladies are “reahed,” ah!
        “reahed”!’”</p>

    <p>“Kate” joined in with a mock quotation from the
        catalog. Interruptions were frequent. “‘The young
        ladies of this school are taught the French language
        according to the natural method. Conversation is encouraged.
        All the work of the French class is conducted
        entirely in the French language. A correct accent
        is insisted upon.’”</p>

    <p>Imitation of the French teachers followed, along
        with samples of the kind of French that was “encouraged.”</p>

    <p>“There’s my proof,” Blynn went on. “Everyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
        here has studied French for one or more years. Some
        of us have been abroad where each had a chance to test
        it out. Who really knows any French, except Leopold?
        I don’t mean ability to read. Anybody can guess what
        French means; but can anyone here really talk and
        think in French? I have met German boys, still in
        school, who could talk with me in English and could
        pass me many times in French. They got it all out
        of their schools. In other words, they gave their time,
        the most precious hours of their lives, and got something
        lasting.”</p>

    <p>The conversation broke in two. The upper end of
        the table were agreeing with Blynn, the lower end were
        trying with much laughter to carry on a discussion in
        French.</p>

    <p>“<i>Je vous aime, je vous adore, que voulez-vous encore?</i>”
        Betty remarked to Diccon. “It means, ‘I just
        dote on you, Dicky-boy.’”</p>

    <p>“<i>Je ne comprends pas</i>,” replied Diccon. “Score a
        point for me. It’s all French, every bit of it guaranteed.
        <i>Je ne comprends pas.</i> ‘I don’t understand.’ I
        used it all over Paris. ‘I don’t understand’ fits anywhere.”
    </p>

    <p>“<i>J’ai un petit frère</i>,” volunteered Davis. “It means,
        ‘I have a little brother.’ I haven’t any little brother,
        but that’s French, all right.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Adieu! Adieu! Adieu!</i>” said Kate.</p>

    <p>They were taking turns. Blynn saw a chance to surprise
        them.</p>

    <p>“Here! children,” he rapped on the table. “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
        a game for you. Each of us will show off his French.
        Leopold is debarred; he is French. No! We’ll let
        him in.... Let me see,” he glanced hurriedly about
        the table. “We’ll take partners, each talk to his
        <i>vis-à-vis</i>.” He produced his watch. “I’ll make it
        easy. One full minute speech and one full minute reply.
        Time out for all pauses. Repetitions not allowed.
        Get ready. Kate and Diccon will begin, the gentleman
        first.”
    </p>

    <p>Gorgas leaned over eager-eyed to watch the fun, until
        swiftly it came to her that she and Leopold would be
        last. Toward Blynn she cast a terrified appeal.</p>

    <p>While the first two were blundering joyfully through
        their minute he slipped around to her and whispered.</p>

    <p>“Please carry this out for me! If you say the word,
        I’ll have them excuse you.... I’ll take all the blame.
        It’s only fun. Please!”</p>

    <p>“All right,” she nodded. But her face, for a humming
        second, lost some of its ruddy tan.</p>

    <p>Their ludicrous book sentences encouraged her, and
        made her feel suddenly strong and unabashed. Into
        her mind came pictures of clear, blue-sky days with
        Bardek gesticulating and spouting his vivid jargon.</p>

    <p>Davis was telling about his brother. “I have a little
        brother. <i>J’ai un petit frère</i>,” he announced with great
        eagerness, and stopped. Betty had got through by
        cleverly remembering a conjugation: “I drink, you
        drink, he drinks, she drinks, it drinks, we drink,” etc.
        Mary claimed foul on the ground that conjugations
        didn’t make sense; but her own contribution was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
        familiar medley: “<i>Monsieur, bureau, Lafayette, encore,
            dèpot, merci, madame, bon-bon</i>.” Morris tried “Alice
        in Wonderland.” “’Twas brillig and the slithey toves
        did gyre and gimble on the wabe,” but was caught; although
        he insisted that it was as much French as anything.</p>

    <p>To be sure, no one was really trying. Betty, no
        doubt, could have blundered along tolerably well, and
        Davis had taken part in a French play, much of which
        he probably remembered. The game was a frolic and
        was so played, until Leopold spoke.</p>

    <p>“<i>Ma chère amie</i>,” he leaned over and gazed earnestly
        at Gorgas. He was a dark, grave looking man, the
        type of scholar Jew. Everyone, of course, could follow
        his carefully chosen phrases. “When I look into your
        eyes,” he said slowly, “I see treasure there; for you
        have that which the world, with all its seeming care for
        franc and sou, regards ever as above price. First,
        you have youth, with the future all to spend; and you
        have faithfulness, a vast store—I see it in your steady
        brown eyes; and you have beauty born of these two,
        youth and faithfulness. And besides, while you speak
        seldom, and sit serene apart, you have rare, rare
        thoughts. Would that I could share them.”</p>

    <p>It seemed almost like a trick to play upon Gorgas,
        the unschooled. There was a little uneasiness. Mrs.
        Levering was about to give an appropriate excuse when
        Gorgas replied.</p>

    <p>Her tones were deep and French to the very roots.
        Her features changed; turns and twists of eye and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
        mouth, which she had caught unwittingly from Bardek,
        swept across the animated young face and gave a new
        charm to her words. Ah, how often lately had Bardek
        made much that same speech to her! And how often
        had she flamed in reply! Tonight she was swift to rebuke
        the man before her, first, for his open flattery—Gorgas
        was quite wrong, here, as she found out later;
        Leopold was never more honest—and secondly, for his
        attempt to make a public jest of her. Gorgas could
        never believe that she was good to look at; always she
        grew flustered at sudden praise, suspecting some hidden
        irony.</p>

    <p>She came back with nervous, rapid-fire Gallic, a sudden
        contrast to his deliberate language. She told him
        that he should not have said that sort of thing to her,
        especially before all these people. It may be true.
        She would not deny that she had all the virtues, but her
        friends were those who did not gabble smart phrases
        about her eyes and her ears and her nose as if they
        were properties for sale. Why couldn’t he have talked
        of impersonal things as the others had? Well! He
        would be paid back in kind. Well! She would look
        into his eyes, and what does she see? <i>Sapristi!</i> Nothing;
        for his eyes are away. They are busy watching
        the faces of girls and reporting lies about them!</p>

    <p>Leopold, astonished at the spirited attack, offered
        a most humble apology, and protested his sincerity,
        keeping steadily to the French, which was to him almost
        a second tongue. She tossed him aside with a swift
        change of mood. She knew that it was all fun; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
        that sort of personal praise always made her unhappy.</p>

    <p>He had not thought she would understand, he offered
        in excuse.</p>

    <p>That did not help his case a bit, she returned quickly,
        for then he had evidently sought deliberately to make
        her a laughing stock. “Vous voulez rire,” she said,
        “mais je n’aime pas qu’on se moque de moi!”</p>

    <p>Their parley grew less warm. He forced her to
        laugh by pointing out the gaping crowd of elders. He
        told her that no one present could possibly give a translation
        of their conversation, for it had been carried on,
        not in the studied pace suitable for foreigners, but
        clipped and jammed into a swift colloquial clatter.</p>

    <p>“Look at Diccon,” Leopold went on, still keeping
        away from English. “He is so surprised, his mouth
        won’t come shut for a week. And Betty, she—” and
        so on until nearly everyone in the company was tolled
        off.</p>

    <p>Sensation! The discovery that the Prince really
        wanted Cinderella after all was nothing in comparison.
        Where did she get it? Had she lived abroad? No.
        Had she gone to school? No. Then she must have
        had tutors. Ah! There it was. Allen Blynn, by
        way of silly books, had done the trick. Marvelous!
        Hearty congratulations! It was a miracle of pedagogy.</p>

    <p>Blynn denied everything; but they put it down to
        modesty. Needless to say, from that hour Gorgas was
        respected by the elder girls and was brought more into
        their circle. And from that hour, too, she lost the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
        major part of her left-handedness in public. She began
        to move across the room without striking chairs or
        sliding ashamed into secluded corners.</p>

    <p>Some of the same dignity of bearing, so natural in
        the open out-of-doors, began to appear within doors;
        her native comedy spirit, the gift of dramatic caricature,
        gradually unclosed, to the great surprise of her
        elder sister.</p>

    <p class="drop-cap">BLYNN visited his youngsters or had them on his
        own grounds with the regularity of a physician
        looking up his patients. Those that were out
        of reach he held by correspondence. Yet always his
        visits or his letters seemed the most casual thing. The
        youngsters looked for him because it meant a splendid
        sort of play, something organized and meaningful.
        When children play alone they get into ruts and they
        waste great time in small disputes; an umpire or a director
        keeps things moving.</p>

    <p>About this time Blynn began to keep a card index
        of his “cases,” recording all available facts about character,
        and special abilities; and in addition, data to
        show the ground they had covered, with notes of suggestive
        treatment.</p>

    <p>There was no difficulty over any of the cases save
        that of Gorgas. He had not the least notion what to
        do with her. On many counts she was entirely too
        wise for her teacher. He knew that she must have constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
        practice in German, French, and Italian, or she
        would lose much of her previous holdings; she must not
        neglect her work in copper; she should have other
        studies, science, history, literature, mathematics, music;
        and she should have opportunity to continue the development
        of her physical self.</p>

    <p>A forge was constructed in a disused stone spring-house.
        No one interfered with any eccentric device
        that Blynn suggested; it began to be generally conceded
        that he could perform miracles with children—Gorgas’
        French and, later, the discovery of her knowledge
        of German and Italian caused everyone to look
        upon him as a wizard—so there was no objection to
        the fitting-up of a complete coppersmith’s workshop in
        the old spring-house.</p>

    <p>When he came to take stock of her mental furnishings
        he found some strange wares. Gardiner’s “The
        Femine” he had laid to the door of Bardek; but of all
        Bardek’s odd learning, “The Femine” was not a part;
        indeed, he would have scoffed at the contents. An aunt,
        a “Gorgas,” had left her namesake a few hundred
        dollars a year, the interest of which was to be spent in
        books. Ever since she could remember, Gorgas had
        been permitted to spend that small sum as she should
        choose. The effect of the responsibility was to give
        her a keen interest in the book-reviews of such magazines
        as came regularly to the house. And with the
        growth of the private collection, there came also a fine
        love for books.</p>

    <p>Her little “den” was across the hall from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
        library. One afternoon Blynn found her there and
        spent many astonished minutes poring over her treasures.</p>

    <p>“You have read all this?” he inquired incredulously.</p>

    <p>She gave several pleased little nods. “Nearly all.
        Some were too much for me. I shall give them up until
        I grow into them. I get only a few every quarter; so
        it grows gradually,” she explained.</p>

    <p>“Why, some of this is material I ought to know myself—and
        don’t; books I’ve promised myself to read....
        How did you get to know there were such things?
        Bardek, again?”</p>

    <p>Oh, no! The advertisements of the <i>Atlantic
            Monthly</i>; the book chat in <i>Harper’s</i>, and the <i>Nation</i>;
        and especially the remarks of wise persons—like Mr.
        Blynn!—who have no idea that “a chiel’s among ye
        takin’ notes.” There was really a note-book with publishers’
        names and prices; one had to buy carefully so
        as to get the best for the money (Pennsylvania-German
        thrift cropping out here, thought Blynn).</p>

    <p>“That one,” she touched a volume, “he’s too much
        for me. Everybody is talking about him. The magazines
        are full of it; and you and Mr. Leopold are always
        quoting. That made me buy. I got good binding, too.
        Don’t you just love fine bindings?” She stroked the
        leather cover gently. “But I suppose I’ll have to
        know more before I can understand.”</p>

    <p>Browning was the big man in those days; he was receiving
        his belated hero-worship and, as usual, it was
        noisy and overdone.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Blynn ran the pages over and stopped at “Andrea
        del Sarto.” Then he read. It needed only a touch of
        explanation here and there to set the pathetic monologue
        and make clear the simple story of this great
        failure.</p>

    <p>The poem was plain enough now, she said; and it was
        beautiful; but why did Andrea leave his great work,
        give up all that was really dear in life, and in his middle
        days suffer poverty and disgrace, all for that worthless
        Lucrezia?</p>

    <p>Why, indeed! Blynn promised to show her reproductions
        of Sarto’s paintings, especially the fine figure
        of young John the Baptist; then she might understand;
        for Lucrezia was the model for that spiritual face. She
        must have had qualities to inspire a picture like that.
        A man would give up much for a woman who called him,
        even—this is the puzzle of life—even though he knew
        she were worthless.</p>

    <p>“Do you suppose,” she asked, “that in the first years
        of their marriage they were—” She wanted to say
        “lovers,” but that’s a hard word to say aloud in English.
        Except on the stage or in novels, we avoid direct
        reference to love. We seem to be half ashamed of it.
        “Do you think,” she began again, “they really—cared?”</p>

    <p>“I should think so,” he guessed. “Most folks do,
        for awhile. We can’t get into the private history of
        families; but from the outside it seems that—uh—affection,”
        he was also shying at the word, “soon dies out.
        It rather frightens one to look on the hundreds of indifferent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
        or possibly discordant couples who, no doubt,
        were one time violently—uh—enamored of each other.
        It doesn’t seem possible to keep the thing up!”</p>

    <p>“If that’s true, I’m sorry,” she said seriously.</p>

    <p>“So am I.”</p>

    <p>“Why should it be true?”</p>

    <p>“I’ve often puzzled over it. My theory is—”</p>

    <p>She laughed. “Do you know, you always begin that
        way? ‘My theory is.’ But go on, I’m interested....
        I like your theories.... You don’t care if I say
        what I think; do you?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, dear, no!” he smiled. “I was only thinking
        how full of theories I am. I haven’t breathed half of
        them aloud yet.... I wouldn’t dare.... Well, my
        theory is that two people who—uh—”</p>

    <p>“Yes?” She was sitting cross-legged on the floor
        and looking steadily up at him.</p>

    <p>He looked down at her a second or two, studying
        her frank eyes.</p>

    <p>“Would you mind sitting on a chair?” he asked.</p>

    <p>“<i>Mais, oui</i>,” yet she did not stir. “But I am quite
        comfy here, <i>mon père</i>.”</p>

    <p>“Uh!” he grinned. “Don’t call me ‘father.’”</p>

    <p>“You are ten years older,” she contended, “and—”</p>

    <p>“How did you discover that?”</p>

    <p>“I asked Edwin.”</p>

    <p>“Edwin?”</p>

    <p>“Edwin Morris.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, your tennis chum. How old is he?”</p>

    <p>“Eighteen; only five years older than I.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“H’m!” he looked at her suspiciously; but she
        seemed quite guiltless.</p>

    <p>“Why mustn’t I sit on the floor, <i>mon p— mon duc,
            mon prince</i>?”</p>

    <p>She hummed the air of “La Tour, Prends Garde,”
        that old song which the French children sing and act so
        prettily in the summer evenings, reminding us of our
        own “London Bridge is Falling Down.” Gorgas
        touched the words softly,</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first">“Mon duc, mon prince!</div>
            <div class="verse">Mon duc, mon prince!</div>
            <div class="verse">Je viens me plaindre à vous.”</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“Duke and prince?” he shook his head. “I’m too
        American for that.”</p>

    <p>Without further word she sang the next stanza,</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first">“Mon capitaine,</div>
            <div class="verse">Mon colonel!</div>
            <div class="verse">Que me demandez-vous?”</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“Ah, that’s better,” Blynn smiled.</p>

    <p>“And why, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” she smiled back, “may
        I not sit on the floor?”</p>

    <p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” he explained. “It’s—legs.
        I’ve discovered something about you.” He spoke with
        exaggerated jocularity. “When I see your underpinnings,
        I know I am talking to a child, aged thirteen,
        who looks upon me as a grandfather; but when you
        squat on the floor and look up at me like a little
        coquette”—his tone was that of pure banter—“I get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
        the craziest notion possible into my head, that you have
        grown up and—that you are sitting there quietly
        laughing at all my tedious explanation, and well—you
        know, you fooled me completely that day on the tennis-courts.
        I could have sworn you were at least twenty-two.”</p>

    <p>“Why do you need—to treat me—differently?”</p>

    <p>Her eyes rested on him now with quiet gravity.
        They looked into him and seemed to explore his very
        mind. This child had been schooled all her life to mask
        her feelings until few suspected she was capable of any.
        In this confident hour she unmasked and let him see
        without shame that he was her <i>capitaine</i>, under whom
        she would serve right loyally. Youth and faithfulness!
        Blynn could see all that, too, in her eyes; and
        perhaps something else, which disturbed him and caused
        him to come to instant decision.</p>

    <p>“Do you know, young lady,” he broke the spell of
        the silence abruptly, “that in October you are going to
        the Misses Warren’s Select French and English School
        for Young Ladies?”</p>

    <p>“No!” she stood up. “I won’t go. Who said I
        must go? That hateful place? Why, everybody
        makes fun of it. It—it would be torture. I won’t
        go! Please, Mr. Blynn, don’t let them send me there.”</p>

    <p>“But you must go somewhere,” he soothed. “I’ve
        been inquiring. They’ve made a number of changes
        since the death of the elder sister. It’s really quite a
        decent place now. What you need is not book education,
        but social education.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“What!”</p>

    <p>“I put that badly. I mean you should mix more
        with your own generation. There are girls who—”</p>

    <p>“Girls! I don’t want to know any. Most of them
        are just simpletons, smirking at boys. Boys! boys!
        boys! That’s their whole talk. They aren’t interested
        in books or anything. I tell you, I couldn’t stand being
        all day with girls. I couldn’t breathe. I—”</p>

    <p>“Now, steady,” he calmed her. “I won’t make you
        do anything you don’t want to do. That’s a bargain;
        isn’t it? No Warren business, if you don’t like it.
        Remember, you’re going to do as you like.”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” she said more calmly; but all the rebellion in
        her was stirring.</p>

    <p>“To tell you the truth, I haven’t worked out the
        plan yet. The Warren school is—well, I’m thinking
        about it. I’ve been looking into the School of Applied
        Arts, too.”</p>

    <p>“That’s more like it,” she was blinking hard.</p>

    <p>“You see,” he showed her his perplexity. “You
        and I aren’t getting anywhere. We just sit around and
        talk and talk—at least, I do—”</p>

    <p>“But that’s the joy of it,” she was astonished at
        his sudden dullness. “Don’t you like our—talks?”</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul, yes! They’re great! You bring me
        out; make me think of things I didn’t know I knew.
        Enjoy it? Jerusalem! But your mother thinks I am
        teaching you things—”</p>

    <p>“Why, you are,” her eyes grew wide. “Every day
        I learn <i>lots</i> from you. I can’t give you up, Mr. Blynn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
        Why, we have the most beautiful pow-wows. Nobody
        else really talks to me. Look,” she picked up the
        Browning, “you have given me Andrea today; I never
        could have gotten it myself. And I’m just nervous
        thinking of more you will give me. Don’t—don’t—send
        me off, just when we were—. It’s mean!” she
        quavered, stamping her foot in vexation, for she had
        prided herself on not being a weeping person, and
        lately the tears were swelling on the flimsiest provocation.</p>

    <p>But he was firm about regular school and took pains
        to make his reasons clear to her. His scheme for her—which
        gradually began to form as he talked—was
        special hours at Miss Warren’s in German and French.
        They had a new Swiss teacher there who had a splendid
        bi-lingual training. She would also get music, mathematics
        and Latin. Once or twice a week she would
        take the metal classes in the School of Applied Arts.
        The Italian she would have to keep up by reading, for
        awhile at least.</p>

    <p>“But English literature?” she protested. “Aren’t
        you going to keep on with your readings? Why, we’ve
        hardly begun!”</p>

    <p>“Perhaps,” he held out. “Some of it I will surely
        do; perhaps I’ll arrange a little class with your sister
        and Betty Sommers.”</p>

    <p>“That will not be so nice,” she admitted. “But,”
        with seeming understanding of the expression that
        swept across his face, “if you think it best, <i>mon capitaine</i>,
        I’ll give them a share.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Youth and faithfulness shone in her eyes again; and
        the frankness of childhood.</p>

    <p>He collected his belongings, borrowed a book from
        her shelf and prepared to go.</p>

    <p>“There!” she said. “I knew we had forgotten
        something. That horrid school thing hopped in between
        and spoiled it all.” She held the Browning open
        to “Andrea del Sarto.” “You were telling me your
        theory about married people, and why they don’t—keep
        on—keep on—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes,” he helped. “Well, my theory is a very
        simple one. There is no patent on it, but no one seems
        to want to use it.” He knitted his brows and looked
        afar off. “I think young people ought to prepare
        ahead of time for all that’s to follow. They get lost
        in the beginnings—for there are beginnings, and there
        are middles and ends, each is different. They ought to
        prepare themselves to go on from one stage of affection
        into another, without surprise or suspicion of each
        other. And better, they should study all the little
        paths that tend to take them apart. Therefore, they
        should cultivate many of the same interests, insist upon
        having many associations together, and refuse to let a
        separate set of occupations absorb them too much—like
        housekeeping or whist playing for the woman, and
        selling cheeses, let us say, for the man. Memory is the
        thing that binds one’s life together; married people
        should see to it that they have many, many beautiful
        memories in common. There! that’s a long speech; and
        it’s my theory. There must be a flaw in it somewhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
        or more folks would have adopted it. I have faith in
        it—I have faith, you notice, in all my theories. One
        should. If ever I have the chance to try it out, I’ll do
        my best to make it work.”</p>

    <p>“It will work,” she said simply.</p>

    <p>“That’s encouraging, now,” he laughed. “What
        makes you think so?”</p>

    <p>“My theory is that the woman is always willing to
        have memories, the kind you speak of. It is the man
        who flies off to his own affairs and leaves her to just
        dig along.”</p>

    <p>“Ah! Amazonian,” he cried. “That’s out of Gardiner!”</p>

    <p>“No,” quietly. “I have been watching my neighbors,
        that’s all. Men are awfully excited about men-things.
        I don’t blame them. They do have lots of
        fun, boys and men.... But you will make it work, all
        right.”</p>

    <p>“Why?”</p>

    <p>“Well,” she thought, “you will try; and then you
        aren’t at all interested in yourself—No! you aren’t—You
        are always thinking of somebody else. I’ve
        watched you—”</p>

    <p>“Oh!” he cried, “you’ll make me self-conscious.”</p>

    <p>“Often, I’ve watched you. I notice that your eye
        is always looking to see what other persons need. You
        get chairs before other men notice they are wanted, and
        you open doors, and pass things before they’re asked
        for, and all that sort of thing.... And, you understand—”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Understand?”</p>

    <p>“Yes; you understand ... you understand—me,
        for instance.”</p>

    <p>They looked at each other a quiet second or two.</p>

    <p>“I wonder if I do,” he said, trying to smile like a
        grandfather.</p>

    <p>They walked across the hall into the library.</p>

    <p>“Oh, you know all about little me,” she laughed, and
        shook her head as if it were a doleful burden.</p>

            “BONG-JOUR”</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THE winter was spent for Gorgas pretty much
        as Blynn had planned. She was entered as a
        pupil in the Misses Warren Select French and
        English School for Young Ladies; but the desertion
        from freedom was not made easily; nor was it ever entirely
        successful. Gorgas was the vagabond type. In
        literature Vagabondia has its charming unconventional
        men, but seldom if ever has the female of this species
        been put forward without shocking sensitive souls. The
        unconventional woman is—well, no better than she
        should be. Somehow the world has worshipped its men
        when they step forth from its fetters of use and wont,
        but it looks terribly askance at women of equal daring.</p>

    <p>On the morning of the opening of school Gorgas rode
        solemnly on Gyp, without even the “shining morning
        face” of Shakespeare’s famous reluctant schoolboy.
        She was full of forebodings of coming disaster. Professor
        Blynn, her <i>capitaine</i>, had said, go; that was the
        sole impelling force. She knew that she could not turn
        back without distressing him; he it was who had taken
        the rebellious untamed forces of her little life and had
        bound them both with and against her will. It was terrible,
        this bowing to the decisions of another; terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
        and unutterably satisfying! She pondered on this contradictory
        fact as she let Gyp trot forward; upon the
        convicting desires that found reasonable lodgment in
        her mind: the desire to turn Gyp’s head right about for
        a canter toward Bardek and Cresheim Valley, and the
        greater wish to obey the will of another, to plod straight
        forward and suffer the pangs of a strange schooldom.
        Her conscience had a fine glow of satisfaction with each
        step toward the disagreeable adventure.</p>

    <p>Miss Warren saw her from the window.</p>

    <p>“Surely that is not one of our new girls?” she exclaimed
        to the secretary.</p>

    <p>Both drew aside the heavy lace curtains, discreetly
        keeping themselves at a polite distance in the shadows.</p>

    <p>“It is Gorgas Levering,” the secretary replied.</p>

    <p>“But she is riding astride!” Miss Warren looked
        helplessly about. “Like a man!” she added.
        “Mercy! Do go out and tell her—”</p>

    <p>But Gorgas cut that command short by dismounting—like
        a man. She was leading Gyp toward the
        stables, one arm over the horse’s mane, her head erect,
        her eyes focused far away. At that moment she was
        enjoying a childlike delight in successful martyrdom.
        As she passed around the school—really a fine old
        Colonial mansion—she came face to face with Miss
        Warren framed in a massive side door.</p>

    <p>“You are Miss Gorgas Levering, I presume?”
        Miss Warren made the statement with disarming
        graciousness.</p>

    <p>“Miss Warren!” Gorgas ejaculated.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The child was startled by the apparition, conjuring
        up the photograph on Keyser’s dressing-table, that now
        spoke in the flesh, like an ancient figure in history suddenly
        come to life; and her spirits oozed. The regality
        of this distinguished-looking woman struck at her and
        took away her sense of equality. In the presence of
        Miss Warren one had always to struggle against an
        overwhelming feeling of personal inferiority.</p>

    <p>“I am so glad you have come early,” Miss Warren
        ignored the exclamation. “Perhaps you would like to
        come in and freshen yourself after your ride.”</p>

    <p>Miss Warren’s attire was spotless. Without a further
        word Gorgas realized that there was something
        vulgar and unclean in riding a horse. She became
        conscious of her dusty appearance and of Gyp’s warm,
        sweaty body.</p>

    <p>“Home, Gyp,” she said, and turned his head about
        and patted him smartly on the flank. Gyp trotted off
        alone.</p>

    <p>Miss Warren took in the unconventional attire.</p>

    <p>“You are wearing—uh—bloomers; are you not?”
        she asked in a noncommittal tone.</p>

    <p>Then Gorgas answered in a phrase she had never
        before used in speaking to her elders. It was the reply
        of servants and underlings; something she knew should
        not be said, but it came unbidden to her lips.</p>

    <p>“<i>Yes, ma’am</i>,” she said.</p>

    <p>Instantly she was aware of having surrendered her
        will completely to the overpowering superiority of the
        woman before her. Her face flamed; she would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
        given all she possessed to have recalled the expression;
        but it was out, and she was condemned. From afar
        she heard the quiet explanation from Miss Warren that
        young ladies should not say “yes, ma’am”; they should
        say, “Yes, Miss Warren.” All of which she knew by
        instinct, yet she could offer no explanation. She was
        suffused with shame.</p>

    <p>“It is too late to ask you to go home and change,”
        Miss Warren spoke kindly as she ushered Gorgas into
        the house and showed her the way to the water-taps.
        “Fortunately we have a few proper skirts in the lockers
        that you may wear over your—uh—riding costume.
        While you are getting refreshed I will have Miss Lewis
        find one for you.”</p>

    <p>Meekly Gorgas let herself be decked in a faded blue
        serge skirt, which bulged uncomfortably and succeeded
        in taking out of her the remaining grains of spirit. If
        she had entertained any thought of walking through the
        spacious doorway and bolting for Gyp and freedom,
        that inharmonious skirt tethered her to the spot like a
        chain anchor.</p>

    <p>She sat on a bench under a window in the wide corridor.
        A teacher or two came in.</p>

    <p>“<i>Bon jour!</i>” they greeted Miss Warren, who bon-joured
        them in return. “Old Bong-joor,” Gorgas remembered,
        was one of the private names for Miss Warren
        among the alumnæ. Other French phrases, mainly
        about the weather, were passed back and forward.
        Gorgas recognized them instantly as by-words among
        the Warren graduates, and she knew that they were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
        quite French. At least it was not Bardek’s way of
        greeting. That same type of mystic language was
        leveled at the first few early pupils. They replied
        in kind, and seemed to know what was expected of
        them.</p>

    <p>“Bon jour, Harriet.”</p>

    <p>“Bon jour, Ma-de-moi-selle Warren.”</p>

    <p>“Tu est arrivé de bonne heure.”</p>

    <p>“Oui, Ma-de-moi-selle Warren.”</p>

    <p>“C’est bon, Harriet.”</p>

    <p>“Oui, Ma-de-moi-selle Warren.”</p>

    <p>There was something comic in the picture presented.
        The little girls stood at rigid attention and recited their
        trite phrases, keeping diplomatically to the plain <i>oui</i>
        or <i>non</i>, and so added to the glory of “The Misses Warren’s
        French and English School for Young Ladies.”
        Here was the echo far off in America of a one-time
        supremacy of French as the language of the upper
        classes of Europe. Tag-rags of the language lingered
        for awhile in novels, until it finally died out and was
        deposited in the back pages of the old Webster dictionary,
        where the proletariat may still find the meaning
        of such recondite phrases as “<i>entre nous</i>,” and “<i>on
            dit</i>.”</p>

    <p>“I wish you to know one of our new girls,” Miss
        Warren would say occasionally after the French pass-words
        had been given and returned. “This is Miss
        Gorgas Levering.”</p>

    <p>“We welcome you to our school,” the well drilled
        young ladies would recite, step two steps forward, shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
        hands like a drill sergeant, bow and retire to a room
        set apart for assembly.</p>

    <p>More “<i>Bon jours</i>” went on until about thirty girls,
        ranging from ten to eighteen, had assembled. Gorgas
        was ushered in with the others and given a seat. A bell
        was tapped somewhere in the house; the polite unnatural
        murmur hushed. Another bell tapped; the
        girls rose and stood waiting for the customary prayer,
        but a clatter in the hall turned heads and set very natural
        tongues a-wagging. Two or three smart taps on
        the bell brought only partial order. A heavy voice in
        the hallway caused smiles of recognition.</p>

    <p>“Am I late again?” it cried impatiently.</p>

    <p>The words of one of the teachers could not be
        heard, but the reply of the late-comer was quite clear.</p>

    <p>“Darn it, I’m always late!” the heavy voice boomed
        out. “Your old clock’s wrong. I know I started in
        plenty of time this morning.”</p>

    <p>“Bea Wilcox!” The name was uttered aloud by
        several excited girls. Miss Warren called the group
        smartly to attention and requested Miss Lewis to see
        that proper care was taken of the unruly late-comer,
        but while heads turned to the front dutifully and
        silence came, the joyful wreaths on the faces were not
        so easily ordered away. Bea Wilcox was the one rift
        in the morning’s respectable gloom.</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry, Miss Warren,” Bea exclaimed comfortingly
        as she tore off her gloves and took her place in
        assembly. “I tried to get here, honest I did. Your
        clock’s awful fast.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“If you please, Miss Wilcox,” the principal assumed
        her deadliest tones, “we prefer to hear your excuses in
        private. And I wish you would soften down your very—uh—heavy
        voice; and please do not say ‘awful?’”</p>

    <p>A chill passed over the room, thawed instantly by
        Bea.</p>

    <p>“Oh, all right,” she chirped in cheery basso. “But
        it ain’t my fault if the clock’s wrong; is it?”</p>

    <p>“If you will be so good as not to speak. And pray
        remember that ‘ain’t’ is not good English.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, ain’t it?” she inquired pleasantly, adding, as
        if to her compatriots, “but I bet the thingembob’s off
        the pendulum?”</p>

    <p>“Miss Wilcox!” the command was peremptory.</p>

    <p>“Yes’m?”</p>

    <p>The “yes’m” was most deferential. It was meant
        to be. Miss Wilcox was the big, muscular type of girl
        that goes in for athletics, cares little for books, loving
        rather to strive muscle against muscle than to swaddle
        and grow prim and become self-conscious of nose and
        eyelash. These athletic girls are glorious at tennis
        and hockey—Bea Wilcox, at fifteen, was a wonder at
        both sports; she could even bat and play first-base like
        a man—but they are not usually considered refined.
        Delicate intellectual shadings they do not always perceive.
        Her “yes’m” was a rough attempt at respect,
        but it drew a titter from the precise young ladies.</p>

    <p>The titter from the comic “yes’m” had hardly died
        out before a far-off bell, tolling lazily, proclaimed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
        in at least one church tower a belated nine-o’clock was
        being celebrated.</p>

    <p>“There!” cried Miss Wilcox, striking a listening
        attitude. “Listen! D’y’ hear that! Ah! ha! Miss
        Warren! We always go by that bell. I told you you
        were fast.”</p>

    <p>“You will kindly leave the room, Miss Wilcox,” Miss
        Warren spoke with dignified forbearance. “Pray, go
        to my office.”</p>

    <p>“Now, what have <i>I</i> done!” The young lady moved
        belligerently toward the hallway. “Always getting
        <i>jumped</i> on for doin’ <i>nothin’</i>.”
    </p>

    <p>What <i>had</i> she done? Gorgas asked herself. But
        she did not ask aloud. Nor did anyone else. Thirty
        youngsters watched the unlucky Wilcox girl flounce out
        of the room, each knowing that it would mean a long
        lecture, a detention after school, the punishment of
        much memorization of Bible verses, and perhaps the
        writing out of a thousand replicas of the sentence,
        “Children should be seen and not heard”; and certainly
        it would mean a letter to the elder Wilcoxes, in
        which Bea would not appear a heroine. There was no
        protest from her own mates, except the mute flash of
        understanding from one to the other which implied that
        here was one more irresistible victory of authority over
        justice.</p>

    <p>Gorgas found herself marching in a silent line—silent
        save for some furtive whispering as they turned
        safe corners in hall or stairway—supervised by ferret-eyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
        teachers. She was tolled off to a group that met
        in one of the western rooms on the second floor. Trees—big
        chestnuts—shot above the windows and left a
        view of lawn and rising hill beyond; and some of their
        leaves brushed just beyond reach, so that they could be
        heard distinctly as they whisked back and forth against
        the house.</p>

    <p>Teachers came and went. They heard lessons
        mainly, and gave marks in a book for every word
        spoken. While they were gracious in a sort of unbending
        way, they seemed ever alert, like a Trappist lady
        superior, to catch someone breaking the eternal vow
        of silence. Even as they relieved one another on guard,
        they would watch the class with worried, roving eyes,
        until the last reluctant moment. That vigilance crept
        into their faces; it labeled them wherever they went,
        even in their vacations!</p>

    <p>Gorgas was mercifully permitted to look on during
        the long hours of that first day, although she was given
        detailed instructions for the lessons that were to be
        learned by the morrow. There was a long spelling list,
        including Cambodia, peristyle, ratiocination, caryatid,
        and other hard ones; a list of the mountains of the
        world with the exact height of each; a section of American
        history to be memorized—the story of John Smith
        and Pocahontas, which nobody believes nowadays—the
        conjugation of several French verbs, and some
        problem in arithmetic which aimed to discover that if
        fourteen men working six hours a day could dig a ditch
        four feet wide, six feet deep and ten feet long in three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
        days, how many men working four days, seven hours a
        day, it would require to dig a ditch three feet wide, five
        feet deep and twelve feet long. And there was “literature”:
        the memorization of the dates of birth and
        death of Cotton Mather and his contemporaries.</p>

    <p>The French class offered hope at first. Mlle.
        Schwartz—German-Swiss—looked French as she
        bobbed into the room, a vivacious, worried little woman.
        She said, “I <i>hopp</i> you do know the vairbs today.” It
        was a vain “hopp.” The <i>pièce de resistance</i> was a
        future perfect:</p>

    <p>I shall have been regarded,</p>

    <p>Thou shalt have been regarded,</p>

    <p>He shall have been regarded.</p>

    <p>Gorgas, who knew French, found the phrase new.
        She wondered if anyone would ever need to “have been
        regarded.” But to Mlle. Schwartz it was the open
        sesame to all of French; that and its even more bristling
        negative interrogative:</p>

    <p>Shall I not have been regarded?</p>

    <p>Shalt thou not have been regarded? etc.</p>

    <p>The prize of Mlle. Schwartz’s praise went to a little
        be-spectacled girl on the front row who knew her “shall-have-been-regarded’s”
        backward and forwards.</p>

    <p>“Ah! Bessie,” Mlle. Schwartz would pounce on her
        in despair of the others, “the past anterior!” Bessie
        knew the past anterior. “The pluperfect!” Bessie
        knew the pluperfect. And the subjunctive, and the indicative
        interrogative.</p>

    <p>Gorgas felt ashamed. She knew no French, after all!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
        In spite of all her chatter with Bardek, she was ignorant
        of the language. So she edged over to the Bessie
        girl at the fifteen minute recess, shyly, as one would
        toward a superior.</p>

    <p>“It was beautiful,” Gorgas spoke quickly in French,
        a nervous tribute to the perfect scholar. “Ah! how it
        was beautiful, the conjugations which you know so
        well!”</p>

    <p>“Huh?” Bessie looked across her spectacles. She
        was munching a bun, and spoke with difficulty.</p>

    <p>“The French that you know so wonderfully!”
        Gorgas kept eagerly to the French. “I speak it and
        read it, but I never knew about the conjugations. Is it
        very hard? When I heard you speak I was ashamed
        not to know them. They all seemed so familiar, yet I
        did not know them.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t she talk funny!” Bessie smiled weakly at
        the group beside her. Then she added, “I don’t understand
        her. Is it some foreign language?”</p>

    <p>“But you know French!”</p>

    <p>“Was that French what you just spoke?”</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>“Gee! girls!” Bessie looked about her. “She can
        talk in French!”</p>

    <p>“But you do, too,” Gorgas was fearful of being alone
        in this.</p>

    <p>“Me?” inquired Bessie. “No. I don’t know any
        <i>speakin’</i> French. I only know conjugations. <i>Speakin’</i>
        French don’t come for years—not till you get to college.”
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>A heavy voice interrupted. It came from across the
        lawn.</p>

    <p>“Whoo-oo!” it called joyfully and drew nearer.
        The owner was loping in ungainly bounds. “I’m let
        out!” Bea Wilcox shouted. Then she glanced at the
        office corridors and lowered her voice to a hoarse whisper
        which penetrated almost as far as her normal tones.
        “I’m loose! Don’t come too near, everybody.” She
        put her long arms around the nearest girls, one of
        whom was Gorgas, and hugged them to her. “I’m
        dangerous, I am! Old Bong-joor said I was—the
        sweet old Lavender-Box. She said I was to be par-tic-u-lar-ly
        careful”—old Bong-joor was being imitated
        now—“not to obflusticate the fiddlesticks of these deah
        innocent guhls, especially the young lady, Miss, uh,
        Brownface, who had just enrolled. Where’s Brownface?”</p>

    <p>Brownface was being hugged gloriously by Bea’s
        strong right arm.</p>

    <p>“Oh! Oh!” Bea cried as she loosed the other arm
        and hugged Gorgas to her. “Be careful, Browny.
        Don’t get too close to me. I’m dangerous!” Back
        and forth she rocked Gorgas. “I’m ketchin’. I’m the
        human colery morbus.”</p>

    <p>“And she can talk in French,” piped up Bessie of
        the spectacles.</p>

    <p>Bea thrust Gorgas at arms length.</p>

    <p>“Can you?”</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>“Honest?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>“Is it ketchin’?” This with mock fear.</p>

    <p>Only laughter answered this question.</p>

    <p>“Well, I want it to be.” Bea nodded her head vindictively.
        “I want to ketch a whole lot of it. Old
        Bong-joor gave me ten pages of French exercises to
        write out. Browny, you’re my lucky stone. I’m going
        to love you.” She grabbed Gorgas once more and
        rocked her like a baby, “Will you do every one of them
        for me?”</p>

    <p>Gorgas said she would be glad to help.</p>

    <p>“Help?” croaked Bea. “I don’t want help. I
        just want you to do the whole biz for me. I can’t even
        punctuate in French. And see here, Bessie Four-eyes,”
        she reached forward with her foot and drew that lady
        nearer, “if anybody ‘spills’ this to Bong-joor—<i>anybody</i>,
        mind; I’m not sayin’ who—they’ll have their
        backbones taken out <i>very carefully</i> and dusted off—bone
        by bone.”</p>

    <p>The good arm never left Gorgas. It protected her
        and warmed her and temporarily drove off the chill of
        the school-house.</p>
    <hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

            HONORIFICABILITUDINITATIBUS</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">BUT even the impetuous friendliness of Bea
        Wilcox could not quite dispel the chill of the
        school-house. Until some arrangements could
        be made for afternoon hours at the Applied Arts School
        Gorgas was to spend her whole day at the Warren
        School. They were hours of dreary inactivity, enforced
        silence, enforced immobility; and “lessons” that
        appealed to no normal healthy instinct.</p>

    <p>In two weeks Gorgas rebelled. Every night she had
        memorized dutifully the odds and ends of unprofitable
        facts that had been detailed for home study. But they
        would not stay fixed in her mind. She knew the exact
        height in feet of Mt. Etna, the list of the counties of
        her native State with the name of the chief city, innumerable
        pages of a stupid political history of the
        United States, lists of births and deaths, and the population
        of a score of cities. Bessie and her tribe, weaklings
        physically, shone in the class-room. They
        “knew” everything. They were eager to display and
        greedy for book-facts; but they never questioned the
        usefulness of anything.</p>

    <p>“The population of New York city, Miss Levering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
        please?” Miss Lewis, the geography teacher, was quizzing.</p>

    <p>“May I ask, Miss Lewis,” Gorgas plucked up courage
        to inquire, “why anyone should have to know that?”</p>

    <p>“Please do not be impertinent, Miss Levering.”</p>

    <p>Miss Lewis was not a good disciplinarian and she
        knew it. A native graciousness and meekness prevented
        her from succeeding in quelling pupils; but she
        struggled hard to dominate.</p>

    <p>“Oh, I don’t mean to be impertinent,” Gorgas went
        on eagerly. “But population is always changing.
        Our book tells us the number of people who lived in New
        York, but only for 1880. Why, that was eight years
        ago! With millions of immigrants and—uh—births,
        you know, it must be much bigger now. When you were
        a school girl you had to memorize populations, but,
        you see, they’re of no use now. We’ll have to do it all
        over again after the census of 1890; won’t we?”</p>

    <p>“I—I—well, I suppose so; yes,” Miss Lewis had
        never questioned the traditional pabulum of the school
        course. She was not of courageous mould. “But I
        am afraid you will have to learn your lessons just the
        same. So kindly answer my question: what is the
        population of New York?”</p>

    <p>“But, don’t you see,” Gorgas did not notice the eager
        movement among her classmates, who took sides instinctively
        in favor of every rebellion against authority;
        nor did she see the weak look of fear and determination
        in the eyes of her teacher. “But don’t you see,
        no one can tell? And what do you mean by New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
        city? All the people who live there? Or the people
        who visit New York—they say there are thousands
        and thousands of visitors. And what about Brooklyn
        and Jersey City—I’ve been looking at the map—it’s
        all one big city. I know a man who lives in New Jersey
        who has his business in New York, and he says there are
        thousands like him. How can you tell how many there
        are in New York city this minute? Nobody could possibly
        count them.”</p>

    <p>“If you do not know your lesson, Miss Levering, I
        must ask you to be seated.”</p>

    <p>“But you don’t understand,” Gorgas was enthusiastic
        in her childlike earnestness. “Nobody knows
        that lesson. Even <i>you</i> don’t know it, Miss Lewis.”</p>

    <p>All might have been well, but, unfortunately, the class
        broke into an unpremeditated whoop. Tappings on
        the desk brought no respect for authority. The youngsters
        saw nothing but lovely audacious baiting in Gorgas’
        innocent speech.</p>

    <p>The tumult brought Miss Warren to the door. Gorgas
        was still standing, conscious now, as evidenced by her
        flushed face, that she had caused trouble. Silence fell
        like a blight on the group; one youngster tugged at
        Gorgas’ skirt, aiming to be helpful; and another risked
        punishment by boldly whispering that “Bong-joor”
        was at the door.</p>

    <p>But Gorgas could not retreat. That would be to
        acknowledge wrongdoing. So she not only stood her
        ground, but continued speaking.</p>

    <p>“I don’t see the use of it, Miss Lewis, really I don’t.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“What is it that the young lady does not see the
        use of?” Miss Warren inquired majestically. Even
        Gorgas knew from the tone that she was already judged
        and destined for her first punishment. Miss Lewis
        lamely tried to put the case; she wanted to be fair, but
        her little four hundred dollars a year, her very life, in
        fact, was at issue; she could see failure hovering before
        her, so she plucked up a borrowed strength from the
        orderly class and threw the blame upon Gorgas.</p>

    <p>Miss Warren was quite calm. “I have noticed that
        Miss Levering, unlike her sister, who was a great credit
        to our school, does not easily conform to rules. She
        does not keep a good ‘line,’ and I notice that she talks
        to others in the halls. I had meant to speak to her
        about this, and other matters that have come to my
        attention, but preferred to wait, hoping that as she
        was new to us she would eventually understand and submit
        to authority. But it seems that my forbearance
        was a mistake. We cannot have rebellious spirits in
        our school, Miss Lewis. It would not be fair to the
        parents who have entrusted to us the moral responsibility
        of training their children and who look upon our
        school as an environment free from contaminating influences.
        At recess time, Miss Lewis, will you be so
        good as to send the young lady to my office?”</p>

    <p>“I have done nothing wrong, Miss Warren,” Gorgas
        stirred her nervous tongue to say.</p>

    <p>Miss Warren fixed her with a smile.</p>

    <p>“I can quite comprehend,” she said, “that you think
        you have done nothing wrong. However, your parents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
        wisely or not, have permitted us to be the sole judge in
        such matters. You will find us very fair and very
        just; and also very firm.”</p>

    <p>The interview with Miss Warren was full of the same
        numbing type of monologue. But no other “punishment”
        followed. Gorgas was led to feel that she was
        on probation; that mercy had been shown to her ignorance
        of the rights of constituted authority; and that
        her future stay in the school would be entirely dependent
        on herself. In the whole interview Gorgas spoke not a
        single word.</p>

    <p>But she raged, nevertheless, at the public humiliation.
        In the recess periods the girls hailed her with
        delight, but she got no joy from that. Mistily she
        thought of Bardek and the free play of thought that he
        allowed, by which she learned prodigiously every minute;
        and she thought of Allen Blynn, who treated her as
        a human being and opened up springs of intellectual
        delight for her thirsty soul; and even of Leopold, who
        talked science with her as if she were a colleague. And
        in none of her conversations with those men had there
        been aught of heights of mountains, and boundaries of
        counties, and populations of cities.</p>

    <p>One evening, when she had been struggling to memorize
        a list of uses of the French subjunctive, she resolved
        to rebel. Leopold had dropped in and had
        wasted the best part of her study period by chattering
        with her in French. Together they had reviewed the
        French lesson for the morrow and agreed that for them
        the French subjunctive did not exist.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Even the French do not know those rules,” he told
        her. “And many persons know them perfectly without
        knowing French at all.”</p>

    <p>“Then I will not learn them,” Gorgas closed her book
        abruptly.</p>

    <p>“I wouldn’t do that!” he laughed. “Miss Warren
        will send you kiting. And then what will you do?”</p>

    <p>“I will leave school,” she decided. “I can’t breathe
        in that place.”</p>

    <p>But she resolved to tell Allen Blynn first. It grieved
        her to disappoint him; so she would not take the decisive
        step until she had informed him of all the necessities of
        the case. He had certain rights, she admitted.</p>

    <p>But Allen Blynn was hard to find. His visits to the
        Leverings had been most infrequent and casual. A suspicion
        had come to her sensitive soul that he had preferred
        not to see much of her. Her entrances had
        usually been the sign for his leave-takings.</p>

    <p>She tried to get courage to go directly to him; she
        had even got so far as the house; but always she fled.
        So she took the weak course and wrote him:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><i>Dear Mr. Blynn</i>:</p>

        <p>I am going to leave school immediately.</p>

        <p class="right">I remain,<span class="gap">Very sincerely yours, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
            <br>
            <span class="smcap">Gorgas Levering</span>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>The next mail brought an answer.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p><i>Dear Miss Gorgas</i>:</p>

        <p>You are not going to do anything of the sort—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
            least not until we have had a good talk on Saturday
            afternoon, beginning promptly at three o’clock.</p>

        <p>I also remain,</p>

        <p class="right">Very sincerely but very firmly yours, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <span class="smcap">Allen Blynn</span>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>On Saturday afternoon she was waiting for him on
        the old-fashioned settle before the door of her home.</p>

    <p>“Hello, missy!” he called to her from the gate.
        “When do you graduate?”</p>

    <p>“S-sh!” she whispered, and nodded toward the
        house.</p>

    <p>As he drew near he gave a mock whisper in return,
        “I’ve figured it out that they must have promoted you
        a class every two days and a half. So you’re to graduate
        immediately. Tell me about it.”</p>

    <p>“We’ve got to walk,” she spoke low.</p>

    <p>“Whither, fellow conspirator.”</p>

    <p>“To the tennis-courts.”</p>

    <p>“Ah!” he mimicked an actor, “’twas there we met.”</p>

    <p>“This is no joke,” she declined to catch his spirit.
        “I’m going to quit.”</p>

    <p>It was October and the tennis-courts were bare; so
        they had the field to themselves as they sat on the home-made
        judge’s bench.</p>

    <p>“‘Begin at the beginning,’” said Blynn, “as the
        King said to the White Rabbit, ‘go on until you come
        to the end, and then stop.’”</p>

    <p>The tale was unfolded, populations, scoldings, subjunctive
        and all.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Blynn laughed. “Is it as bad as that? I had no
        idea the school was such a dungeon. Why, it is supposed
        to be a first-class institution! I’ll never believe
        another prospectus.”</p>

    <p>“Do <i>you</i> know, Mr. Blynn, how many people are in
        New York city at this minute?”</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul, no!” he shook his head ruefully. “I
        shouldn’t want to have that on my conscience. It’s
        much easier to take the count of 1880.”</p>

    <p>“But that wasn’t right, even in 1880,” she continued
        seriously.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” he laughed; “New York has grown bigger
        even while we’ve been talking; or maybe smaller, for
        half the town may have gone to Coney Island for over
        Sunday.”</p>

    <p>“What does it matter how many people live in New
        York?” she asked. “I want to know; really. Miss
        Warren thinks it very important—although she
        doesn’t know herself how many were there even in 1880.”</p>

    <p>“Well, bless my soul, did you ask her?”</p>

    <p>“Yes; she told me to come in and see her if ever I
        wanted to know anything. So one morning I asked
        her about New York. She made a guess, but she was
        thousands off. ‘Excuse me, Miss Warren,’ I said—I
        was sticky with politeness, ‘but I think that’s what it
        was in 1820. I’m <i>sure</i> it’s grown bigger every year
        since that time; but I suppose that was the correct answer
        when <i>you</i> went to school.’”</p>

    <p>“Ha! And what did she say to that?”</p>

    <p>“She looked me over <i>very</i> carefully, but decided that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
        I didn’t look bright enough. I didn’t. I flattened my
        face out—this way.” Her face took on the appearance
        of a dull image; life went out of her eyes.</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul, Gorgas, don’t! You look feeble-minded!”
        And Gorgas knew that Allen Blynn was
        paying the actress a stupendous compliment. “Go
        on!” he said. “Go on! This is great!”</p>

    <p>“Then I told her the right number, but pretended
        to guess it—1,202,299—that’s what the book says,
        anyway. All the time she was hunting for a geography.
        ‘I’m sure that is not right, Miss Levering,’
        but it was: 1,202,299. She hated me for knowing it,
        too; I could see it in her eye, and I just knew she
        wouldn’t let me stay right. ‘In 1880,’ I helped her.
        ‘Ah!’ she swallowed the bait. ‘Of course, Miss Levering,
        in 1880! But that was eight years ago. Since
        then, I have no doubt, it has increased considerably—considerably.’
        ‘How much is it now, Miss Warren?’
        I asked as if she knew everything; ‘how much exactly?’
        She swelled up and said, ‘Well, we shan’t be able to tell
        that until the next census is completed. Of course, no
        one knows exactly.’”</p>

    <p>“Treason!” cried Blynn. “She ought to have been
        scolded for that speech!”</p>

    <p>“And in public!” Gorgas was still vibrating from
        that open rebuke. “That’s why I got my dressing
        down before the whole class, too. I’ll never forgive her
        for that. It was beastly. So I just said sweetly, ‘I
        am <i>so</i> glad you say that, Miss Warren. That’s what
        I told Miss Lewis, but she said it was still 1,202,299.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
        It’s funny, too,’ I went on; ‘for that’s what you reprimanded
        me for before the class. Thank you <i>so</i> much.
        Goodby,’ and I shot out before she could recover.”</p>

    <p>“That’s very subtle,” Blynn commented. “Do you
        really think she caught your jab?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes indeedy! If you could see the beady look
        in old Bong-jour’s eye the next morning. She was
        ready for me, but so was I. When she bong-joured me
        I bong-joured her back. Bong-jour! Huh! She
        doesn’t know French, either.”</p>

    <p>“Of course, she doesn’t,” Blynn chuckled. “Most
        of that school French is the woodenest stuff. How did
        you find out, Missy?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, when she Bong-joured me that morning, I
        came back fast. It took her off her pins. I asked
        her questions in French, and then told her in English
        that she hadn’t answered ’em. I came later than the
        rest so as there’d be a crowd around. I made her own
        up that she couldn’t follow me. She tried to talk me
        down high-and-mighty-like, and pretend that my French
        was bad; but I jabbered right off to Mlle. Schwartz.
        Ma’m’selle isn’t very strong on the French herself—”</p>

    <p>“What! Another fraud!”</p>

    <p>“Well, she can do the French all right, but she’s
        really German and got her French mostly out of books.
        But she’s a demon on conjugations and rules.”</p>

    <p>“Well, did Ma’m’selle stand by you?”</p>

    <p>“You bet. I just went a little slower for her. She’s
        afraid of me—more afraid of me than she is of Bong-jour—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
        she always slams French back at me, to show
        she understands.”</p>

    <p>“Well!” Blynn was delighted. “Did the old lady
        own up?”</p>

    <p>“Partly, but everybody in school knows she’s an old
        fraud. She cried, ‘Slower! Oh, slower! <i>ma cherie, s’il
            vouz plait</i>,’ with a gasp after each word. But I never
        slower-ed a minute. I jabbered all the faster.”</p>

    <p>“And so you’re going to chuck it?” he inquired
        mildly.</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>He thought for awhile—to her a disconcerting
        thing; it made her feel in the wrong.</p>

    <p>“Oh, I shouldn’t mind the fool lessons, perhaps,” she
        took new ground, “if it weren’t for the hours of silence,
        sitting at wooden desks without so much as a squirm.
        Some day I’ll break out and scream.... You don’t
        think I ought to stay, do you, Mr. Blynn?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” he nodded cheerfully. “Bad as it is, my advice
        is to stick.”</p>

    <p>“Why?”</p>

    <p>“It’s a part of my philosophy.”</p>

    <p>“What’s philosophy?”</p>

    <p>“Philosophy?” He dug his stick in the sod at the
        edge of the court. “It’s one’s theory of life.”</p>

    <p>She hugged both knees and settled back on the bench.</p>

    <p>“I like your theories. Tell me about it.”</p>

    <p>“My theory is—”</p>

    <p>They both laughed at the memory of the time they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
        had talked over “Andrea del Sarto,” and he had been
        prolific of “theories.”</p>

    <p>“It’s hard to put into words,” he mused. “You
        know, I’m what the Irish call a ‘spoiled priest.’”</p>

    <p>“What’s that?”</p>

    <p>“It’s a man who starts out to be a priest, but falters
        on the way and becomes a teacher. He’s a priest just
        the same; the religious strain is strong in him; he will
        preach on the slightest provocation. No matter what
        he does to earn a living, he will find his main interest in
        soul saving. There’s always something of the religious
        zealot in him.”</p>

    <p>A look came into his eyes that explained better than
        words what he meant by zealot; it is the same sort of
        intense stare, a focusing on some distant ideal, that
        gives the mark to ascetics and martyrs and socialists,
        and certain types of reformers. It wasn’t a pleasant
        look, but it made one confident in the man; confident
        that he would drive himself, against his own interests,
        to fulfill the duty as he saw it.</p>

    <p>“Well,” he made an attempt to begin, “it seems
        very unreasonable to you that teachers should ask you
        to know what they don’t know themselves; to learn
        things that are of no use; to walk ‘in line’ when you
        might saunter out your own way; to keep silent when it
        would do no harm to talk. It seems unreasonable,
        doesn’t it?”</p>

    <p>“Well; it is!”</p>

    <p>“I agree with you—absolutely senseless and unreasonable.
        At the same time, I would obey the rules.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Why?”</p>

    <p>“Because I am afraid of sensible and reasonable
        things.”</p>

    <p>“I’m not!”</p>

    <p>“If it were the custom everywhere to walk into the
        schoolroom backwards, I should do just that.” His
        eyes narrowed, and the lines about his mouth grew tense.</p>

    <p>“That would be silly.”</p>

    <p>“So is the commandment, ‘Thou shall not kill.’”</p>

    <p>“What!”</p>

    <p>“The reasonable, sensible thing to do is to kill.
        That’s why we go to war. Killing is the most natural
        emotion, and it is the acme of reason. No murderer
        ever feels guilty. He has justified his act by the highest
        reasons of self-preservation and self-advancement. We
        live in the most rational age the world has ever known.
        We have reasoned away all restrictions. There is no
        such thing as authority any more. In some western
        states they have abolished the common law, and in the
        east certain classes of society have abolished even the
        common decencies. It is unreasonable, they say, to be
        true to one’s wife, to revere one’s mother, to obey
        parents, to pay debts, to stand by a friend, to vote for
        civic betterment. All the commandments are unreasonable,
        including the greatest, ‘Love thy neighbor as thyself.’
        All that we call moral and right is unreasonable.
        And I believe they are unreasonable. Sin is as justifiable
        as righteousness—more so, perhaps. I believe
        that, but I also believe that ‘the wages of sin is death’;
        that’s why I am afraid of reason.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Isn’t it reasonable to be good to others?” Gorgas
        inquired wonderingly.</p>

    <p>“I’m afraid not.” Blynn’s lips were compressed; his
        gaze was fixed on the farther trees. “Books have been
        written against it. Goodness is weakness, they tell us;
        and so it is. The only right is might, they tell us; and
        that is undoubtedly the law of survival. Deceit, the
        snare, devouring murder—that is the supreme law
        of Nature. I believe that; and yet.... I cannot take
        my side with evil, even though I perish.”</p>

    <p>Suddenly he laughed. The slight hardness went out
        of his eyes—that hidden scourging priest deep within
        him—and <i>mon capitaine</i> took its place.</p>

    <p>“Heigh-ho!” he whistled. “Don’t let me get
        started on that sort of speech. I’m a little mad on that
        side. I warn you. If ever I get going again like that,
        say, ‘Honorificabilitudinitatibus.’... It’s a charm
        out of ‘Love’s Labour’s Lost.’ Shakespeare invented
        it.”</p>

    <p>“I’ll never say it.”</p>

    <p>“Say ‘Honorificabilitudinitatibus,’ and keep your
        fingers crossed.”</p>

    <p>“I won’t. That would be <i>most</i> unreasonable. I
        want to hear more.”</p>

    <p>But he did not go on. “Mother had a horse once
        who got into the oats,” she offered in illustration. “He
        foundered. I suppose he thought eating oats was reasonable
        enough.”</p>

    <p>“Well, is it not?” Blynn looked at her. “There
        are things I want to do that are as reasonable as that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
        I have gone over every point of the argument and I
        can’t find a flaw in the reasoning. Every decent instinct
        I have says, Go ahead. But the unwritten code
        of my race, the summed up wisdom that we call custom,
        says, ‘No. Go ahead and you will repent in unforeseen
        miseries.’... ‘There is a way that <i>seemeth</i> right
        unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.’...
        So I obey. There are those who scoff at the
        candles on the altar, who grow pert at the expense of
        old mysterious faiths, who would jostle cheek and jowl
        with Deity. I can quite understand them; but I would
        hesitate to follow them in very deed.... Did I hear
        you say ‘Honorificabilitudinitatibus’?”</p>

    <p>“No.”</p>

    <p>“What are you puzzling over?”</p>

    <p>“I was wondering what all this has to do with old
        Bong-jour. I know it means I’ll have to go back and
        stand it; but it isn’t—” she laughed—“it isn’t reasonable.”</p>

    <p>“No; it isn’t,” he nodded, “and that’s the very reason
        you should go back. The wisdom that is older than
        either you or I, Gorgas, says that youth must submit;
        must endure; must bow to other wills. ‘A boy’s will’—and
        a girl’s will—‘is the wind’s will.’ The way
        toward strength and mastery is first to submit. In
        some respects you should be thankful that the way is
        hard. The more foolish your school exactions are, the
        wiser you will become in discovering them. Already
        you have grown enormously, due to the Warren School.
        It has brought out your wits to match their stupidity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
        Remember, I don’t say to submit ignorantly. There’s
        no growth in that. Give yourself up to the law; but
        keep your judgment ever on the alert. Extract every
        ounce of knowledge from your serfdom; but yourself be
        free. The essence of freedom is not rebellion, but intelligent
        surrender.”</p>

    <p>The sun began to drop down behind Chestnut Hill.
        A pleasant crispness came into the October afternoon.</p>

    <p>“It’s time to go back,” Blynn arose. “I’m afraid
        the ‘spoiled priest’ has bored you.”</p>

    <p>“I like him.”</p>

    <p>“He likes you; you are a splendid communicant.
        You never interrupt the service.”</p>

    <p>“Service on the tennis-courts!” she laughed as they
        jogged down the hill together. “But you won your
        service,” she smiled up at him.</p>

    <p>“Good girl!” he spoke quietly, a deep, congratulatory
        tone that gave her a joyous surge of delight.
        Troubles vanished. Her mind became clean-swept as
        if by magic; pure, sterilized of rebellious miseries. It
        was mental healing. “Good girl! I’ve won my service;
        yes; and I’m glad. But according to the rules
        it’s your turn to serve now. I’ll be watching every
        gain you make. It’s a great fight, the fight against
        oneself. Glorious! Don’t give in an inch!”</p>

    <p>He was of only fair height, a spare youngish sort of
        chap; she was tall for fourteen; so they might have
        been taken at that darkened hour for a pair of loitering
        swains.</p>

    <p>“Where will you be waiting?” Gorgas asked.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“From a near distance,” he answered.</p>

    <p>“Why are you so stingy with your talks?” She
        darted the question with characteristic abruptness.
        “This is the first real good one we’ve had since
        ‘Andrea.’”</p>

    <p>A group of friendly neighbors passed. The frank
        smiles on their faces showed that they appreciated the
        joke of twenty-four and fourteen promenading together.
        But it struck Blynn like a slap in the face.
        He glared and raised his hat energetically.</p>

    <p>“I must not hover about you,” he spoke almost
        sharply. “The neighbors would be talking in no time.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, they began that long ago,” she spoke without
        the least concern. “What do I care what people say!
        Don’t stalk like that. I can’t keep up with you.”</p>

    <p>“Well, I do!”</p>

    <p>“Do what?”</p>

    <p>“Care what people say!” he was terribly in earnest.
        “I care mightily. You can’t ignore the mass of
        unseen thoughts and opinions about you. It’s a force
        like the sea that can rise and swallow you. Don’t set
        your own opinions up and ignore all that,” he waved
        his hand over Mount Airy. “You will be like a canoe
        in mid-ocean. ‘You don’t care what people say!’
        Be careful. Sometimes the voice of the race is speaking.
        And the race is older and wiser than any single
        person in it. Buried instincts of the race come to the
        top, and, behold, you have ‘what people say.’ The
        voice of the people is sometimes the voice of the devil;
        and sometimes it is the voice of God.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“What <i>was</i> that word I was to say—Honorifica—what?”</p>

    <p>“‘Honorificabilitudinitatibus!’” he laughed heartily,
        like a good sportsman.</p>

    <p>“Well, honorifica—whatever it is!” she said firmly.
        “What you said this afternoon may have been all right;
        but this is just stuff and nonsense. Do you think I’d
        care what anybody in Mount Airy said about me?
        They’re a pack of blithering fools.”</p>

    <p>“Well, perhaps you’re right,” he said cheerfully as
        he bade her goodby at the gate. “‘Honorificabilitudinitatibus’
        is a great charm. It always brings me to
        my senses! Goodby, Gorgas.”</p>

    <p>“Goodby,” she repeated, and turned slowly up the
        walk. To herself she said, “The fools! The fools!”
        The memory of the smirking faces that passed them was
        full upon her. “The fools! Now they’ve scared him
        off; just when things were going nice!”</p>

            SIXTEEN</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">GORGAS was now fastened up to a schedule—her
        life became organized. Without a
        word she gave up her open fight against the
        unreasonableness of the traditional school customs;
        accepted the absurdities, and performed the mechanical
        tasks as if they were really worth doing; and she found,
        after a while, that, once the ritual was learned, the service
        was not very exacting either in brain or time.</p>

    <p>The need for tutoring being eliminated, the regular
        weekly dinners at Levering’s gradually broke off.
        Readings in literature were tried once or twice with a
        small group, but they developed into rather tame and
        stilted affairs, and were dropped.</p>

    <p>The winter of ’88 and ’89 drifted by before anyone
        was ready for it to go. The next year Blynn spent in
        Germany, where all good scholars went in those days,
        and during the winter that followed his return, the intimate
        connection with the Leverings seemed almost ready
        to break off naturally.</p>

    <p>Several times Blynn and Gorgas took the afternoon
        to themselves and read poetry and talked. There was
        nothing tame nor stilted about these literary exercises;
        rather, they were warm with the glow of sincere feeling;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
        but they never achieved the perfect freedom of the
        earlier meetings. Allen Blynn seemed to be growing
        aloof and pedagogic, and Gorgas was enveloped for
        good in the protective reserve of the young woman.</p>

    <p>Leopold dropped in upon the Leverings with a semblance
        of regularity. In a crowd he was smilingly
        silent; but as an intimate guest he came out and talked.
        The latest news of the biological sciences—all the new
        mysteries and dramatic new discoveries—he put before
        them simply and clearly, although he made no concessions
        to Gorgas’ youth. She thrilled with gratitude
        because he never once spoke to her in a patronizing way
        or seemed to consider for one moment that she could not
        comprehend every discussion; and her acquisitive young
        soul expanded.</p>

    <p>And Ned Morris went on playing tennis with Gorgas
        until a place had to be set for him regularly at the
        Levering luncheons and dinners, and on the days of five
        a. m. practice games, at breakfast, too.</p>

    <p>She was sixteen in September—September 10, 1891—and
        gave a “party”—one of those affairs where
        everything is planned seriously, as if for excited children—a
        cake with candles, ice cream in animal moulds,
        snap bonbons, and guests in semi-masquerade—but
        where all the so-called children smile satirically and go
        through the ceremonies in exaggerated earnest. It is
        really a farewell to childhood.</p>

    <p>Kate wrote Blynn his invitation. “Gorgas,” she
        said, “insists upon celebrating her sixteenth anniversary
        with due ceremonies of cake and candle and partner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
        At her suggestion and with the approval of
        myself I herewith invite you to come and be my partner.
        Take care before accepting. I have no idea of
        the duties of partners. Perhaps you may have to bob
        for apples in tubs; or you may have to play ‘Copenhagen’
        and kiss the little girls. It will be outlandish
        and <i>non compos</i> and characteristic of the Levering
        Liberty Hall—that you may be assured. I fancy that
        we old folks will look on, (Gracious! I am twenty-five.
        O Petruchio, why stayest thou so long in Verona!)
        while the children cavort.</p>

    <p>“The ladies will masquerade mildly. I shall wear
        my mother’s evening gown of 1861; so you must perforce
        keep a respectable distance.”</p>

    <p>To the great satisfaction of everyone—they all were
        busy folks and had had a slight chill at the suggestion of
        children’s party—the guests were simply the old dinner
        group with the addition of Bea Wilcox. Diccon
        and Davis were wringing each other’s hands as Blynn
        entered; Leopold was gaily chatting with Gorgas in
        French; and Mary Weston and Betty Sommers were
        crowding around Ed Morris, shaking both hands at
        once.</p>

    <p>“What has Ed been up to now?” inquired Blynn.
        “Graduated or something?”</p>

    <p>Everyone laughed; Blynn looked so eager and so
        innocent of the world’s doings.</p>

    <p>“Ed’s ’89,” Leopold reminded Blynn.</p>

    <p>“You ought to know,” chirped Davis, “your marks
        probably pulled him through.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Mary Weston took Blynn by the lapels. “Allen
        Blynn, don’t you really and honestly read the newspapers?
        Ed Morris has done gone and won the tennis
        singles championship of Philadelphia county.”</p>

    <p>“By the Great Horn Spoon, boy!” Blynn gripped
        his hand. “I’m mighty glad to know that. Why, I
        did see an account of some Morris taking the trophy,”
        he defended himself, “but I didn’t connect you with the
        business. Why, man, I’d have been there to see you
        do it.”</p>

    <p>“And you didn’t hear about the exhibition mixed
        doubles, either,” Bea tugged at his other lapel.</p>

    <p>“Bless us all!” cried Allen, “don’t tell me you have
        taken in Montgomery and Lancaster counties, too?”</p>

    <p>“It was only an exhibition, Bea,” Gorgas called
        out from across the room, “the others didn’t half
        try.”</p>

    <p>“Hush, child,” retorted Bea, “when yo’ mammy’s
        talkin’! The fact is—the latest news is—that Gorgas
        Levering and Edwin Morris gave a jim-crickety
        exhibition against the champion ‘mixers’ of the East
        and—”</p>

    <p>“Bless us again!” exclaimed Allen, “don’t tell me
        that they beat ’em; eh?”</p>

    <p>“Yes!” said Bea, “they beat ’em.”</p>

    <p>Chorus of protests followed; a babel of correction.
        Blynn stopped his ears, until Gorgas could be heard.</p>

    <p>“No, Mr. Blynn,” she said, “we lost two sets of
        10-8 each. We were nearly fagged, weren’t we, Ed?
        And they were fresh as daisies. They didn’t try; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
        Ed did all the work. What did you fib for, Bea, and
        drop us down so hard?”</p>

    <p>“I repeat,” said Bea solemnly, “<i>They</i> beat <i>’em</i>.
        Who’s to dispute that? The professor of English here
        asked, ‘Did <i>they</i> beat <i>’em</i>,’ and I just wanted him to
        take more care and pains with his English and not go
        sp-pilling his p-pronouns p-promiscuously all over the
        p-place. So, I just said, ‘Yes; <i>they</i> did beat <i>’em</i>.’
        And so they did.”</p>

    <p>“Aw! What’s pronouns between friends?” queried
        Diccon, the editor. “Here the girls get all togged out
        in their mothers’ clothes, and we’re talking ‘newspaper.’”
        That brought a fresh outburst, mainly an
        attack on Diccon.</p>

    <p>“Sport’s ‘newspaper,’” he explained laconically.
        “I make ’em—’em here stands for both sports and
        newspaper. What’s in the newspaper is sport; the rest
        don’t happen. Blynn didn’t know anything about Morris
        because he forgets to read the newspapers—and I
        ran Ed in on the first page, too. Ah!” he sighed,
        “What is fame?”</p>

    <p>At that moment Kate came slowly into the room
        and courtesied. She wore the small hoops of a young
        lady of ’61, a dainty costume, when it is not exaggerated;
        and some of the charm of that sedate attire found
        its way by contagion into the personality of the wearer.
        Gentleness and sweetness were her prevailing charms
        that evening.</p>

    <p>Blynn watched her with open interest; an occupation
        which she did not miss, even when her back was toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
        him; but he was only thinking how that crinoline period
        had been much maligned, and was fancying that her
        mother must have been just such a shy, timorous creature
        a quarter of a century ago.</p>

    <p>Mary and Betty had discovered ill-mated parts of
        gowns of the early ’80’s—skin-tight sleeves, lace shawl
        and enormous bustles. Bea Wilcox wore a genuine
        child’s dress, her younger sister’s, and, with her height,
        looked as scandalous as she intended.</p>

    <p>Later, on the lantern-lighted porch, Blynn was aware
        of Gorgas standing beside him holding out a hand and
        asking:</p>

    <p>“Weren’t you ever coming over to greet me and wish
        me congratulations?”</p>

    <p>“By the Great Horn Spoon!” he ejaculated, looking
        her over open-eyed. “What’s happened to you?”</p>

    <p>“I’ve growed up, M’sieu’.” Something had certainly
        happened to her. Her masquerade consisted simply of
        the gown her sister Keyser would have worn that
        evening if there had been no disguising. Besides, she
        had coiled her hair.</p>

    <p>“This beats the tennis-court all hollow,” he murmured,
        patently dumbfounded by the change. “<i>Retro,
            Sathanas!</i> Get thee behind me, silk and satin!”</p>

    <p>“Do you like it?” she asked; but staring admiration
        glowed from him.</p>

    <p>“<i>Ein tousand ein hundred ein und zwanzig!</i>” he
        swore à la Bardek. “It’s uncanny, eerie, spooky!”</p>

    <p>“I did it all for you,” she confided frankly. “Hid
        the—uh—underpinnings.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“But good Scotland, girl!” he replied. “That’s
        not the way to please me! Oh, it’s glorious. Goodness!
        You are stunning! But you always upset me
        when you—uh—go without—uh—underpinnings,
        you know. Disconcerts me.” His tone was that of the
        older-man-joking-with-little-girl; but his eyes shone
        with admiration. “Makes me think I ought to treat
        you the way—eh—I ought to be ashamed of myself
        for wanting to. If you’d only giggle or simper—things
        you never do, thank Peter!—it would give me
        the cue, occasionally.”</p>

    <p>“I see you are impressed,” she smiled and tapped him
        on the arm. “That’s what I did it for—just that....
        You’ve got the wrong idea about fifteen and sixteen.
        Older persons always do. Fifteen and sixteen
        don’t feel at all childlike, I can tell you. I’ll never
        be any older than I am now. My mind’s grown
        up—”</p>

    <p>“‘I do not wear motley in my brain, madonna,’” he
        quoted the wise clown, Feste.</p>

    <p>“That’s just it,” comprehending; “and it’s insufferable
        to dress us the way they do—skirts that are
        neither long nor short, hair hanging or half brought
        up with ribbons. And,” she whispered, “you get positively
        ashamed of your—underpinnings. I’ve let out
        the hem of some of my skirts myself—on the quiet.
        You don’t know how comfortable and at home I feel in
        this.” She took several easy steps forward and back.
        “But mother won’t listen to me. I’d be grown up from
        now on if she’d let me.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Others of the party were swarming out on the porch.
        Kate was coming forward to claim her partner.</p>

    <p>“Listen, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” Gorgas spoke hurriedly.
        “I want to have a powwow with you. Stay a few moments
        after the others are gone; will you?”</p>

    <p>He agreed, hardly comprehending what she had said.
        Her eyes were searching him as of old and her hand was
        ever so lightly touching his arm. All convention to the
        contrary, she was a woman, no doubt; but it was the
        delightful childlike quality about her that really
        thrilled him. He was thinking, now that she looked so
        stately and poised, how, after all, it was as a child that
        she appealed to him. A strong, painful desire swept
        him to have just such a brood of his own about him.
        His impulses were domestic and parental, and he was
        twenty-six and childless.</p>

    <p>Kate was talking to him and he was answering with
        one-half of his mind. The other half was following
        Gorgas as she swept across the porch and onto the lawn
        to claim her partner, Ed Morris. Morris was offering
        an arm grotesquely in tribute to her long skirts. They
        marched off gaily.</p>

    <p>That’s the way she would go, he tried to assure himself.
        Some chap of her own generation would take her
        away, and then she would be lost. It was the fate of
        parents to lose their offspring. Real fathers, however,
        had rights and claims. They could put their arms
        about their daughters, pat their cheeks and listen to
        their prattle, no matter who else owned them; and there
        would be no horrid suspicions about the matter. As he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
        heard the ripples of laughter that came from their confidential
        talks out on the lawn, he had a little pang of
        regret. “<i>Mon père</i>,” he remembered how she had once
        dubbed him. “<i>Mon père</i>,” he nodded to himself, “is
        about to lose his <i>enfant</i>; and it isn’t at all a pleasant
        sensation.... It’s like pups,” he grinned. “There’s
        no use trying to own them. You get your affection all
        tied up and then they die and you have to begin all over
        with a new lot. The thing to do is to give ’em away
        quick and forget ’em.”</p>

            MIXED RENDEZVOUS</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">EVERYWHERE at the “party” Morris and
        Gorgas were naturally together. They made
        such a perfect tennis team that each got to
        know instinctively what the other was thinking. Scraps
        of private pass-words and codes flashed back and forth,
        references to games and experiences they had in common.
        He was always being called upon to work at setting
        up chairs or untying ribbons or fastening up a
        fallen lantern.</p>

    <p>“Edwin,” she would turn. “Take a look at my back
        hair, will you? Isn’t that hair-pin tumbling out?”</p>

    <p>He would inspect critically and put the offending
        member into shape, like a familiar brother.</p>

    <p>“Don’t forget the bonbons,” she would call after
        him, as he hurried about preparing things, like one of
        the family. “They’re where you put them—on the
        top shelf in the pantry, you know.”</p>

    <p>At supper the cake was cut and each candle blown
        out with a rhymed wish. Gorgas had arranged the
        seating with Blynn on one side and Morris on the other.
        With Morris she squabbled playfully like a child, but to
        Blynn she turned an impish womanly mien.</p>

    <p>“Take your elbows off the table, Eddie,” she pretended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
        to give little sisterly slaps. “Where are your
        company manners?”</p>

    <p>To Blynn she would turn the next minute, and mimic
        a lady dining out.</p>

    <p>“The plans for this winter’s opera are stupid; don’t
        you think? Nothing but Wahgner—we’re getting
        our share of Wahgner—and the old Fausts and Carmens
        and Trovatores. That new opera of Puccini is
        already stale in Vienna, and we haven’t heard even
        excerpts in the orchestra. It’s like a stage given up to
        continuous Uncle Tom’s Cabins.”</p>

    <p>Another time she came at him with the intonation of
        a gushing old lady. “How <i>int</i>’r’sting!” she beamed
        suddenly at one of his remarks about the Academy exhibition,
        a topic she had forced on him. “<i>Have</i> you
        seen the Cyclor<i>ah</i>ma of Gettysburg? They say it is
        <i>re</i>-ally <i>thrill</i>-ling. <i>Quite</i> the illusion of distance, you
        know. One <i>ought</i> to go.”
    </p>

    <p>For some unexplainable reason Blynn’s humor failed
        him. He tried to talk with her on the strange themes
        she irrelevantly suggested, inwardly registering his protest
        at the changes of personality in people. Some of
        his best college chums had grown into impossible young-old
        men and the liveliest girls of his teens frequently developed
        into stupid matrons. Gorgas, he conjectured
        gloomily, was losing all her naturalness; her individual
        mind was being moulded in the common cast.</p>

    <p>He turned his attention to Kate. She had not
        changed, save in so far as her delicate silk attire gave
        her a temporary flavor of blue china and tea roses.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“What is the good news out of Verona?” he inquired.</p>

    <p>“Petruchio has not yet arrived,” she answered
        promptly.</p>

    <p>“Ah! You are not shrewish enough. Katharina
        had a reputation for ugliness of temper.”</p>

    <p>“Ask Gorgas,” she smiled. “She and I have some
        fearful fracases sometimes—not often, though.” She
        leaned back to get a good view of her sister. “Doesn’t
        she look lovely, tonight! It is so droll to see her in
        my gown. I hope I look as well in it. The child is
        growing up fast. Ah, me! She’s my age-warner. I
        shall be jealous of her soon.”</p>

    <p>“I say, Allen,” Diccon called, “going to take that
        professorship at Holden?”</p>

    <p>“Why, how under heaven did you know about that?”
        asked the astonished Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Newspaper,” said Diccon. “We know everything;
        before it happens, too. Want me to run it in, front-page
        display?” he grinned.</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul! Please don’t do anything like that,
        Diccon. It’s a small matter—big for me, of course—but
        of no public interest.”</p>

    <p>A general chorus forced him to a more public explanation.
        Holden College had offered him the chair
        held by his old professor of English. It meant more
        money—an unimportant matter; but, it meant the
        head of things, even though they were small things, and
        the chance to work under his own lead. He had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
        decided, although as it stood now he believed he would
        not go. The big university had its own attraction;
        one might meet an intolerable narrowness in a small
        place; and there were his “children,” about whom he
        felt more or less responsibility. To be sure, they could
        be taken care of.</p>

    <p>“Go!” said Diccon with almost a snap. “Get out
        of this. You’re just a trailer here. Never get anything
        in your home town. Go away. Be a mystery.
        They’ll want you back some day, when others find out
        you’re worth wanting. Band waiting for you, too.
        My advice is to clear out. That’s what I ought to’ve
        done—long ago.”</p>

    <p>The company fell to a discussion of why prophets
        and professors were honored in all cities save their own.
        Under cover of the general talk, Gorgas tapped Allen
        on the sleeve, her characteristic way of getting his attention,
        and spoke in her proper rôle, as old-time
        “pal.”</p>

    <p>“Does this mean something for you, <i>mon capitaine</i>?”</p>

    <p>“I suppose it does,” he replied. “Somehow I don’t
        seem to have any judgment in my own affairs. Prudence
        tells me to go; it <i>is</i> an opportunity; but I have
        almost made up my mind to plod along where I am.”</p>

    <p>“Just what do you mean by opportunity?” she
        asked.</p>

    <p>He explained. As he talked, the really flattering
        offer began to have some meaning for him. It seemed
        now as if he had been careless in letting the letter from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
        the President go for three or four days without so much
        as a reply. But that’s the way he had always neglected
        his personal advancement.</p>

    <p>“I don’t know whether to let you go or not,” Gorgas
        speculated. “Of course, you would be down Thanksgiving
        and Christmas and Easter and vacations?”</p>

    <p>“Sure to.”</p>

    <p>“You might just as well go, for all I have seen of
        you lately,” she added. “Why did you suddenly give
        me up?”</p>

    <p>“I think you have hit upon the one reason that made
        me think of declining the Holden offer,” he was thinking
        hard and did not seem to have heard her question.
        “I’m lazy, I suppose; I hate to make changes. Holden
        would mean boarding and no real home. It would mean
        giving up a mighty pleasant work here and a lot of good
        fellows,” looking about the table.</p>

    <p>Her question seemed to come slowly to the front of
        his mind. He would have made some sort of rejoinder,
        but she was at the moment scolding Morris, who was
        pretending to eat ice cream from a knife.</p>

    <p>They were rising and breaking up before she spoke
        to him again.</p>

    <p>“Don’t forget, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” she plucked his
        sleeve. “You are to stay after the others.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes,” his face lighted up. “Count on me....
        It will be like old times.”</p>

    <p>“How frightfully time flies,” she reverted suddenly
        to a burlesque of the bored lady-out-to-dinner. “Why
        it seems only yestehdee that we wuh children togetheh.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Like a belated jest he began to see through her
        strange airs. “I’ve been frightfully stupid tonight,”
        he admitted. “Some of your fooling was too delicate
        for me; it got completely by—”</p>

    <p>“I’m simply living up to my gown, sir,—in spots.”</p>

    <p>His rather old-young face looked its honest admiration.</p>

    <p>“What’s that thing-em-bob on your—oh! Do you
        belong to a sorority? Why, bless my soul! It’s a fraternity
        pin—eh? remade into a brooch.... Whose
        is it?”</p>

    <p>“Edwin’s; he had it done for my birthday; nifty,
        isn’t it?... You didn’t give me anything, miser.”</p>

    <p>“Little girls shouldn’t wear men’s fraternity pins,”
        he scolded gently.</p>

    <p>“<i>Oui, mon père.</i>”</p>

    <p>“‘<i>Mon père</i>’—ugh! That’s wicked of you, to remind
        me of my years.... But you know about the
        custom, don’t you?”</p>

    <p>“Tell me.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, perhaps it doesn’t always count. In my ‘frat’
        it’s a pretty serious crime, punishable by drinking a
        quart of quashia-water, to give your emblem to anyone
        but <i>the</i> lady. It’s the old, ancient ‘token’ over again;
        love is blind and lovers are dumb; the token given and
        the token received is the time-honored language of a
        contract begun.... But there! That’s all nonsense....
        Of course, you can wear it without any significance
        at all. You’re hardly old enough to contemplate
        an engagement.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Don’t you be too sure, Mr. Professor,” she hummed
        wisely as she strolled away to bid farewell to her guests.</p>

    <p>Edwin was sauntering by. She whistled a private
        signal which brought him swiftly about with an “Aye!
        aye! sir!” “Don’t forget, you’re to stay till the rest
        have gone,” she whispered quite audibly.</p>

    <p>“Not your Uncle Dudley,” Edwin responded cheerily.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>Kate seemed to know that Blynn would remain later,
        for she piloted him to the library as a matter of course.
        Mr. and Mrs. Levering were reading in the alcove in
        the far end of the big room.</p>

    <p>“Let’s ‘owl,’” she suggested. “Owl” was the family
        name for the family habit of staying up late.
        “Let’s ‘owl’ and talk. I’m broad awake. What kind
        of chairs did they have, mother, in ’61? I have the
        hardest time finding one that fits the hoop.”</p>

    <p>She tried several chairs prettily. Certainly that
        style of apparel increased the helplessness of women,
        usually a beauty asset.</p>

    <p>“Come over here, child,” called the mother, “and
        I’ll show you a trick.”</p>

    <p>The trick consisted in slyly slipping out of the hoops—a
        kind of detachable understructure—and leaving
        them in the alcove.</p>

    <p>While he waited, Blynn could hear little contagious,
        intimate laughters from the lawn. Gorgas and Morris
        were helping McAlley extinguish the Chinese lanterns
        and, youthlike, were taking their time about it.</p>

    <p>“I’m the decoy,” thought Allen, rubbing one palm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
        along the side of the face. “Oh, these children! They
        fascinate me with their nimble intelligence and their
        mysterious changes. It’s a great business, dealing in
        children. They give one an enormous amount of joy—I
        fancy it’s the best thing I do, after all; but they set
        me hungering for a pack of my own that won’t desert
        me when I’ve given them all my toys to play with....
        I believe that little minx was flirting with both of us
        tonight. Trying out her new wings! The gown made
        her conscious of things. Ah, well,” he yawned....
        “Hello! What did you do with the flare-bellows?”</p>

    <p>Kate trailed in with a large quantity of subdued skirt.</p>

    <p>“I took the machinery out.... Now! I can sit
        comfortably at last. Oh! I’m tired.”</p>

    <p>She dropped among a lot of cushions in front of him.</p>

    <p>“Any more interesting Elizabethan theories?” she
        began.</p>

    <p>“Plenty,” he replied. “At present I am interested
        in Elizabethan devils.”</p>

    <p>“Tell me about them.”</p>

    <p>“Well,” he hesitated, and then went on, just like a
        professor! “King James claimed that flying devils
        tried to upset his boat in the North Sea, and he personally
        attended the trial of a lot of old bedlams, who
        confessed and were burned. But in some old documents
        in the University I have found something even
        more exciting. One of the genuinely thrilling things
        that I’ve come across is Dr. Dee’s diary, scribbled on
        the margins of old almanacs. He was an astrologer,
        alchemist, mathematician, spiritualist, physician, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
        other words, a 16th century scientist. Elizabeth consulted
        him for propitious days; that is, she had her
        fortune told.”</p>

    <p>Kate snuggled up to listen. He went on thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>“Dee records his cases. Susan G. came to see him
        about her devil. He tries to exorcise it by the laying
        on of hands and much imperative Latin. Then she
        goes away relieved. A servant in the house has an incorrigible
        evil spirit. There is much praying over her
        case and a deal of incantation without permanent cure.
        One day she slips by him on the stairs. His professional
        eye has seen symptoms of the inward struggle
        between imp and human. He follows quickly. She
        slides behind a door at the bottom of the stair. He
        hears a gurgling sound and the fall of a heavy body.
        Behind the door lies the poor maid. The devil had
        tempted her to cut her throat, he says, so that she could
        die in sin and be his in æternum.”</p>

    <p>“I suppose you believe in the Elizabethan devil?”</p>

    <p>“Doesn’t everybody? We’re coming back to witches
        and devils. The Psychological Research Society is
        only 19th century for Dr. Dee; and what with telepathic
        influence urging to crime, and multiple personalities, I
        don’t see anything in Elizabethan so-called superstition
        that we moderns haven’t improved upon.”</p>

    <p>“So love is a contagious disease,” Kate ruminated,
        “and most of us are possessed of devils. Charming
        thoughts! At that rate, one might marry a devil.”</p>

    <p>“Many do,” he laughed.</p>

    <p>“The devil might have me,” she mused, “if he came
        in some guises.”</p>

    <p>“You think you’re joking, but you’re not,” he came
        back in his characteristic bluntness. “Beatrice jested
        in exactly the same tone. ‘I may sit in a corner,’ she
        sighed, ‘and cry heigh-ho for a husband!’—but gave
        herself mightily away then. And do you remember
        Margaret’s reply? ‘Methinks you look with your eyes
        as other women do,’ said she. Now you, Miss Levering,
        you want to marry; of course, you do. It’s as natural
        a desire as hunger. ‘You look with your eyes as other
        women do.’ Millions of women feel exactly as you do;
        and, alack, millions for some confounded civilized reason
        don’t get the chance; or they won’t take a chance
        when they get one. If I were you I’d learn to do something—fill
        your mind with an absorbing occupation,
        basket weaving, rug making, study, writing—something;
        act as if you were never to catch the infection,
        or whatever it is.... That’s what I’m doing....
        Why don’t you be a librarian?”</p>

    <p>“You are the frankest man I know,” she spoke after
        a moment’s contemplation of his earnest face. “I believe
        you are right.... I am loafing my life away.
        And I’m useless as—” she shut her lips together firmly.
        Tears glistened in the lamp-light.</p>

    <p>He leaned forward with great brotherly sympathy.</p>

    <p>“I did not mean to hurt—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no! no! no! You? You hurt? My dear,
        dear man! You haven’t the power to hurt—you are
        so transparent and sincere. It’s—it’s the devil in me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
        I suppose,” she laughed nervously, “that did the stabbing....
        But what is a woman to do? Sit and wait
        for some accidental man to give her the only thing she
        has been made fit for? I wish I did have a job. But,
        lordy! wouldn’t there be a roar if I hired out! Father
        Levering would have a stroke!”</p>

    <p>She dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief.</p>

    <p>“Let’s go out in the air,” she suggested.</p>

    <p>The lanterns had been extinguished, but in the September
        starlight the wide lawn was awake and glowing.
        There they talked familiarly until the Seminary tower
        spoke a heavy “one.”</p>

    <p>Kate had unburdened, as women and children did to
        Blynn; and he had filled her with good, courageous
        thinking, his native gift. They seemed infinitely acquainted
        as they approached the cosy light of the
        library; and Kate was happy again. Her little laugh
        punctuated the conversation often.</p>

    <p>Gorgas? Where had she gone? Blynn made a
        futile search. Ah, children! children! he thought
        grimly; the subtle September night had taken them off.
        He tried the bower at the end of the orchard, whistling
        first, as a precaution—Blynn was a good sportsman—but
        she was not on the grounds, nor in the
        house.</p>

    <p>McAlley, with his lantern, came sleepily out into the
        light of the path.</p>

    <p>“Mr. Blynn,” he beckoned; and then in great
        secrecy, “Gorgas—she’s went to bed. She gives me
        this letter for you. Faith! It’s a cat-nap I’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
        takin’, and almost forgot it all.... Good night, Mr.
        Blynn.”</p>

    <p>“Good night, Mac.”</p>

    <p>The little note said:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p><i>Mon Capitaine:</i></p>

        <p>I waited for you ever so long, and then I peeked in at
            you, but you seemed so happy with Kate that I just
            waited a little longer and then went trotting off to
            sleep. I have so much to tell you. Edwin plays in the
            finals at Haverford, Wednesday. Come and take me,
            please do. You’re to get your own luncheon. We
            start promptly at twelve, because Mac is going to drive
            us over. We can watch the game from the carriage.
            Edwin will get the Club to serve tea. I’ve seen Bardek
            again. And I’m to have an exhibit at the Art School.</p>

        <p>3. Kate looked happy, too. <i>Wouldn’t that be fine!!</i></p>

    <p>“The little matchmaker!” he chuckled at the stars;
        “concocted the rendezvous and all.... It’s young
        Bianca getting the elder Katherina out of the way,
        again!... Shrewd!... And her whole-hearted unselfish

        ’em; true as—” His mind trailed off in search of a
        strong comparison. “Indecision is the vice of life.”
        He walked briskly and tried to shake off uncomfortable
        thoughts. “It’s fine to have things settled.... Oh,
        the luxurious sensation of a mind finally made up!”
        But he walked with a long stride, his hands thrust deep
        into pockets; and his eyes were staring ahead as if
        trying to pluck a new decision out of the darkness.</p>

            TOPIC NUMBER FOUR</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">WHERE are the landaus and barouches of yesteryear,
        overpowering symbols of upper
        caste? Gone with the calash, the chaise,
        the coach and the cabriolet. The formal vehicle of
        the Leverings was called “the carriage” to distinguish
        it from the informal surrey. The “carriage” was always
        driven by Mac, who donned for the purpose a
        special outfit—Mr. Levering’s minim of Quaker blood
        balked at anything suggesting livery—aimed to indicate
        that Mac was just a remove and a half from membership
        in the family. Mac’s name for them was “his
        blacks,” which the Leverings adopted as a private code.</p>

    <p>“Oh, Mac!” Kate would haloo from the rear porch.
        “‘Blacks’ at three.”</p>

    <p>“’Right, Mis’ Lev’ring.” Mac would quite comprehend
        that a call or a drive was on the program for the
        afternoon.</p>

    <p>On the drive to Haverford, Mac was resplendent in
        new “blacks”; his white linen ascot shone beatifically
        from its dark setting, and his new square-blocked hat
        had a small cockade at the side—clearly contraband
        that had escaped the eye of Father Levering. The
        carriage was eloquent of labor.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Blynn remarked the added note of luxury.</p>

    <p>“We just had to smart up a bit,” explained Gorgas.
        “We can’t look shabby and have those ‘main-liners’
        elevating lorgnettes at us <i>all</i> the afternoon.... Oh,
        I’ve been preparing for this for months, getting a little
        new harness here and there, and some fresh paint, and
        working Dad for new ‘blacks’ for Mac. This is the
        first time I put them all together. Ain’t we stylish?...
        Come, get in; we must make the most of every
        minute—”</p>

    <p>“But aren’t we frightfully early? The games
        aren’t until four o’clock, I understand,” Blynn stood
        stupidly contemplating his watch.</p>

    <p>“In, <i>mon capitaine</i>!” she commanded, “before
        mother changes her mind and sends Kate along....
        Do exactly what you’re told. I’m Pippa today,”
        parodying, “This is my <i>one</i> holiday in the <i>whole</i> year!...
        We’re off, Mac; Cresheim, you know.”</p>

    <p>“I ought to have worn my store clothes,” Blynn remarked
        ruefully. “This is awful grand.... Ought
        to have been a band playing as we started off, flags
        waving, whistles blowing—”</p>

    <p>“Hush!” she plucked his arm eagerly. “Don’t let’s
        waste time. I have so much to tell you.”</p>

    <p>“Well,” he looked at her in his old rôle of father-confessor,
        “what has the naughty child been doing
        lately?”</p>

    <p>“First, this is the longest skirt I ever owned.” She
        kicked out and showed just an inch or two above her
        high shoe-tops. “We had a big row over it. Kate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
        says I’m rushing things too fast; want to be old before
        my time. Mother says the neighborhood wouldn’t hear
        of long skirts and hair completely up. I say, I’m as
        old as I dress. Nobody looks you up in the Bible as
        you walk along the street. I don’t wear ‘1874 September
        10th’ on my forehead. And as for the neighbors—”
        she laughed. “Do you remember how Bardek
        bristled once when you spoke about something being
        all right, but dangerous because contrary to public
        opinion?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I want to know,” he interrupted; “you say
        you’ve seen Bardek.”</p>

    <p>“We haven’t reached that topic yet, Mr. Professor;”
        she settled back comfortably. “That’s a subject we
        shall take up later in the course. At present, we are
        discussing clothes. You got me this long dress.
        Thank you.”</p>

    <p>“I? Pray, how?”</p>

    <p>“I put it to mother how you would feel taking care
        of a child all day. They had me all planned for a
        dotted Swiss, pink sash, and a floppy leghorn—ugh!
        and my hair down like Alice in Wonderland’s!... So,
        I stormed and used you for argument. Quoted you,
        too—things you would have said, if—if you had said
        ’em. I pictured the thing; made them see us walking
        hand-in-hand, before all that Main-line crowd, Father
        Rollo and daughter Rollo—me lost in that leghorn!
        Well, they compromised on this.”</p>

    <p>“You did it mighty quick,” he remarked thoughtfully.
        His eye took in the satisfying effect of the close-fitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
        silk “basque,” with its soft, flaring sleeves drooping
        in mysterious folds from the shoulders, and the
        oldish dark hat with its snug cluster of blood-red roses.</p>

    <p>“One whole month,” she told him. “The dressmaker
        comes only on Mondays, you know.”</p>

    <p>“A month?” He was puzzled. “You didn’t know
        I was coming with you a month ago?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes, I did, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” she chuckled. “You
        were all planned, too.”</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul!” he ejaculated.</p>

    <p>“Topic number two,” she announced, “is Holden.
        Of course, you are going to take that professorship?”</p>

    <p>“No!” he spoke sharply. “I can’t possibly do it—The
        fact is—well, I’ll tell you—Diccon got it for
        me. He’s a member of the trustees. I didn’t know
        that. He just pulled for me—awfully fine of him;
        but he used the bludgeon of newspaper power and every
        trick he could lay hold of. There was an immense competition—I
        didn’t know that, either—and he won
        out by a big majority, against the President’s candidate,
        too. I wormed it out of him. He says it’s all
        right—says that’s the way it’s done.... Says he’ll
        make me President next.... Gross!... And I
        thought they had read my little studies—Pooh!
        There’s something humiliating in that sort of thing—even
        if it is customary. I told Diccon I couldn’t take
        it.”</p>

    <p>“What did he say to that?”</p>

    <p>“He said, ‘Think it over.’ I have thought it over.
        It’s no use.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“I agree with Diccon,” she spoke firmly. “You
        ought to go. You must take things the way they’re
        given. I got this dress by arguing the family out of
        their best judgment. I fibbed a little and put up an
        artificial storm—pure dramatics, every bit of it—all
        the time I was thinking how nice a chocolate soda
        water would taste—I just bulldozed them into giving
        in. I asked for more than I possibly could get and got
        what I really wanted. You’re too—too poetic. My
        advice is to go to Holden and be somebody. The other
        fellows were playing the same game—don’t forget
        that!—and they lost. Oh, it was not ideal, but it was
        perfectly fair. Your friends had the stronger pull,
        that’s all.”</p>

    <p>“I abominate ‘pull,’” he muttered, “all I’ve ever—”</p>

    <p>She put a hand squarely across his lips and held it
        there.</p>

    <p>“Hush!” she warned. “That topic is overboard,
        for the present. Let’s be happy on this ‘<i>one</i> holiday
        of the <i>whole</i> year.’” She rolled her eyes, like an ingenuous
        Pippa. “Topic number three is very near.
        I can hear it.” She raised her hand to make a funnel
        of it. “Hoo-eeee!” she called across the ravine.</p>

    <p>“Hoo-eee!” came a familiar bass, followed by a
        crashing of bushes. Mac stopped as if on signal.</p>

    <p>“<i>Grüss Gott! Herr Professor!</i>” he greeted Blynn;
        “H’lo, Mac!” he dropped into colloquial English for
        the driver; but nothing but French would do for the
        lady, “<i>Jolie à croquer, la petite gosse!</i>”</p>

    <p>Bardek, round-faced and smiling, held out gripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
        hands to all three. As if it had been arranged he clambered
        into the carriage and drove on with them.</p>

    <p>“How fine it is to see you!” he looked affectionately
        at Blynn. “This is not a good French day—only
        half and half,” he swept the sky critically, “or I would
        kiss you on both cheek. Ha! How you would jump!
        Oh, but you are so cold in America! You shake the
        hand, sometimes—good!—but you miss much warmth,
        much flow of blood. The love of man for woman, you
        have so! so!” a shrug that showed our lack even there,
        “but the love of man for man you have not at all—a
        great thing.”</p>

    <p>“Bardek,” Gorgas broke in, “I will not have you
        making speeches all over the place. You—”</p>

    <p>“In Bohemia,” he went joyfully on, waving an apologetic
        hand at the interrupter, “we embrace and kiss
        and have hot feelings. Here, you bow or say, ‘H’lo’
        or ‘So long, ol’ man.’ Ach! We are flesh and blood.
        We were made to tingle when we touch. You don’t half
        love what you don’t touch. I keep my hands off this
        little missy—she would not let me smooth her and pat
        her; she jump so! And you, Miester Bleen—là! là!
        <i>là!</i> là!—if I hold you in my arms—or the good Mac
        there, who I love, too—and kiss you on the ears and
        on the head! Cr-r-azy! What you say? Nut-ty!
        To ze Blockley Assylumm, queek! Before he run about
        and bite somebody else. Eh? It is so, is it not?”
    </p>

    <p>“I often feel like that,” Blynn confessed, “with
        men, I mean.”</p>

    <p>“Of <i>course</i>, you do,” Bardek arched his brows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
        “You are human being wit’ nerves,” he said “ner-r-ufs”—“and
        you have gr-reat power of affection bottled up,
        corked, inside of you. But, you are ashamed, eh? to
        show it?”</p>

    <p>“Undoubtedly, quite ashamed. I often want to
        throw my arms over a good man friend—like Leopold,
        for instance—but—I’d die first.”</p>

    <p>“There!” he turned to Gorgas. “He would die for
        that! For a little not’ing peoples die. In Turkey the
        lady would die if she show the lip; in America, the lady
        would die if she show the foot; in Paris, the lady would
        die if she <i>not</i> show the foot. In England, the lady and
        the man sneak away quiet and take the baths in boxes
        in the ocean; in America they dance together in the
        water and show the ladies how to float, so! And, oh!
        so little clothes. Poof! Bah! I would die but for
        only one thing—when I cannot longer get a good
        breath! All else is jus’ foolishness. I—”</p>

    <p>“Bardek,” interrupted Gorgas, “if you talk any
        longer I’ll turn you over to the police as a public nuisance.”</p>

    <p>“See!” he cried. “How queek I be still. <i>Me voilà!
            Silencieux comme une carpe</i>—still like fish!”</p>

    <p>“This is strictly business, Mr. Blynn. Bardek has
        been helping me with my exhibition at the Applied
        Arts—”</p>

    <p>“And it is won-derful, her work. I—ach! That
        is one thing I die for, if they pass law to make me to
        shut up.”</p>

    <p>“They’re going to give me a special exhibition—‘One-man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
        Show,’ they call it. Bardek came back in
        August, and we’ve been working together in my smithy—the
        old spring-house, you know. I couldn’t go down
        the Valley any longer; it wouldn’t look right—”</p>

    <p>“<i>Nom d’une pipe</i>!” he blurted. “The land of liberty.
        Bah!... Excuse!—<i>Toujours silencieux!</i>”</p>

    <p>“So, we worked him in as a friend of Mac’s. Dad
        actually hired him once to whitewash the palings!” she
        chuckled merrily at the thought, as did Bardek.</p>

    <p>“Me! W’itewashes! Oop!” he clapped his hand
        across his ready mouth.</p>

    <p>“Now I have a plan. Bardek is to take that little
        house back of us.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Take</i>?” asked Bardek. “How do you <i>take</i>
        house?”</p>

    <p>She shook a warning finger.</p>

    <p>“The little white cottage, with the garden. You
        own it; don’t you? It is never rented. Well, Bardek
        is to live there, and do copper work. You come to
        see Mother Levering and pump her full of Bardek and
        have him hired for a teacher—to get ready for the
        exposition, you know. Say anything; make up something.
        Mother believes anything you tell her.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Wait!</i>” exploded Bardek. “Please give me to
        speak. I to live in a house? W’ite house wit’ garden?
        and plumbing? and window sashes? and tables and
        chairs? and doors?”</p>

    <p>To each article of the inventory Gorgas nodded.</p>

    <p>“For me,” she added. “All for me.”</p>

    <p>He turned energetically to Blynn. “I make mistake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
        There is one other t’ing I die for—to live like
        chicken in a house....” He looked at her curiously.
        “<i>Nom d’une pipe!</i>” he speculated. “I see I am going
        to do that t’ing.... <i>Nom du nom d’une pipe!</i> I am
        going to live in a house! Wah!” he laughed aloud,
        head thrown back. “You do not know w’at you ask.
        And I do not know w’at I do. I swear, ten, fifteen year
        ago, I take big oath that I nevair again live in house—some
        day I tell you zat story—and now,” he recovered
        and looked at Gorgas solemnly, “I do t’at t’ing....
        All ri’—for you! Good! Bury me in your w’ite
        house.... <i>Nom du nom du nom d’une pipe!</i>”</p>

    <p>“That’s settled,” she turned now to Blynn. “We
        think twelve dollars a month is a good price for the
        cottage—especially since you haven’t rented it for
        ever so long. Mac will get it put in good shape for
        you. Is it a go?... For me!”</p>

    <p>“Take it for nothing,” said Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Well, we’ll call it eight dollars, then,” she resumed.</p>

    <p>“Ho!” cried Bardek, highly amused. “She is good
        at the bargain. In my country the woman get everything
        cheap.”</p>

    <p>“Here’s where you get out, Bardek.”</p>

    <p>“Ach, so soon! Well, I get in, I go housekeeping, I
        get out—<i>comme tu voudras, mon enfant</i>. Some day,
        she say, ‘Bardek, go jump in Schuylkill river, please,’
        and I say, ‘Yes, miss, jus’ please wait till I put on my
        coat.’... Goodby, Mr. Blynn; Goodby, ol’ Mac;
        adieu, Madam Pompadour, who make kings of the earth
        go live in little w’ite closets. <i>Adieu!</i>”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Farewells were waved until Bardek could be seen no
        longer.</p>

    <p>“Topic number four,” she took up the next part of
        her program abruptly. “I’m not going to let you
        drop me, Allen Blynn.... I just won’t stand it.”</p>

    <p>She spoke hurriedly and nervously. Allen Blynn
        was quite taken by surprise.</p>

    <p>“It isn’t fair. You said you would take charge of
        me, my education, I mean; you told mother you would;
        everybody thought so, too; and then, you just—walked
        out.... For the last year I’ve seen you only
        once or twice on the streets, and you’re always rushing
        somewhere.... What have I done?... We’ve got
        to settle this thing right here and now. I’ve been thinking
        and thinking and I can’t make it out. You just
        avoid me as if I weren’t fit to—” the storm began to
        subside. “Of course, I don’t mean that. But why
        can’t we be good pals, like we were? Why not, <i>mon
            capitaine</i>?”</p>

    <p>The abruptness of the thing almost overwhelmed him.
        The contrast between her gaiety in dealing with Bardek
        and the almost bitter seriousness of the present mood
        was a shock.</p>

    <p>His excuses she listened to without a word of interruption.
        He began by showing that when he found
        schools for her his business as educational agent was at
        an end. Then his university teaching, his studying, his
        writings, and the care of his little charges, who could
        not always go to expensive schools, all that had absorbed
        him. Besides, the old group had broken up of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
        its own accord—one of those accidental, unplanned
        things that happen. His year in Germany, too, had
        made an unlooked for break. There he ended.</p>

    <p>“When you were in Germany,” she spoke with great
        deliberation, “I wrote to you. Didn’t you get the letter?”</p>

    <p>“Why, yes—to be sure, I did. Of course, I did—eh—Didn’t
        I answer it?”</p>

    <p>“You know you did not.”</p>

    <p>He knew, and showed it painfully.</p>

    <p>“Why?” she kept to the point.</p>

    <p>He couldn’t exactly say; he was always careless;
        wretched personal habits he had.</p>

    <p>“I am asking you a question. Why did you not
        answer my letter?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, how can I tell you, Gorgas,” he writhed, but
        she was merciless.</p>

    <p>“That’s what I intend to find out. It’s got to be
        settled right now—this whole business.”</p>

    <p>“Very well,” he concluded. “I’ll try to tell you.
        Your letter was all right—”</p>

    <p>“No, it wasn’t. It was six, gushing, gloomy pages
        of homesickness for you. I had the blues awfully. Nobody
        around the house attempts to try to understand
        me or give me a fair show. You came along with a
        whole new world and called me ‘pal’ and let me in, and
        when you shipped off without ever giving me a hint that
        you were going, I was so flabbergasted I sat down and
        poured out. I posted it that night—in the rain—and
        cried the rest of the night because I had sent it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
        But I said, ‘Allen Blynn is the one man on earth who
        will understand a lonely child.’... But, it seems you
        didn’t.... Can’t you realize the—the—agony of
        every day that brought—nothing? If you had
        scolded me or something, I should have felt all right.
        But you just—shut up.”</p>

    <p>She stared ahead of her in blurred indignation. The
        little, blood-red roses on her hat were trembling. He
        could see that she was striving to control her excited
        breathing.</p>

    <p>“Little girl,” he spoke kindly, “that was a great
        blunder of mine. To think that I hurt you—is almost
        unbearable.... I thought I understood children, but,
        bless my soul!—I don’t know the beginnings. Let me
        tell you something. I am quite sure that every time I
        got hold of a pen or pencil, even to write so much as a
        postal card, I thought of your letter and wondered
        what I should do. I couldn’t decide. Several times I
        planned letters to you—”</p>

    <p>“Honest! You really did?” she gasped.</p>

    <p>“Yes, indeed. But, you see, I didn’t at all understand
        your letter. I’ve received loads of letters from
        children, but this one—why, child, it was—oh, now
        that I understand your ‘blues’ and all that sort of
        thing, it’s clear enough. But, you see, this was too—too—”</p>

    <p>“Go on,” she spoke determinedly; “it was! I meant
        it to be!”</p>

    <p>He made up his mind to speak plainly to her.</p>

    <p>“You were a little child,” he began.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“I wish you wouldn’t forever harp on ‘child.’ I
        was no child. I was fifteen years old, and knew exactly
        what I was about. If I had been a fifteen-year-old
        puppy you’d have given me credit for something.”</p>

    <p>“That’s just the point—the only point; you were
        not a puppy, but a girl-child of fifteen, writing a very
        sentimental letter to a man of twenty-five. The rules
        of the game are very clear, my dear. The man of
        twenty-five must not encourage sentiment, or he is a—a—foul
        thing. It’s the law of our civilization; and I
        was not free to break it.”</p>

    <p>“‘America! Ze lant of Leeberty!’” she mimicked
        Bardek softly. “‘You couldn’t write what you thought....
        No, I see that.... You’d have been ashamed,
        wouldn’t you?... It is one of t’ t’ings you would
        die for, eh? <i>Wass?</i>’”</p>

    <p>“Absolutely!” he spoke with conviction. “Bless
        my soul!”</p>

    <p>“All right,” she regarded him carefully. “You are
        forgiven—almost.... You made me so blamed mad,
        by just letting me slide that way, that I could have
        done things to you. Well, that’s all over and I feel
        better. I couldn’t quarrel with anybody very long
        today; this new dress fits too well; but I just had to
        have this thing out with you, Allen Blynn, or—or—”
        She could not think of an adequate figure of speech.</p>

    <p>“Now,” she went on; “topic number—what number
        is it? Five, I think. Topic number five. Tell me
        all about Germany. That’s the last topic till we reach
        Haverford. Just go on, and on, and talk and talk, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
        I’ll snuggle up in this corner and listen.... Hurry!...
        Begin!”</p>

    <p>She leaned back in the cushion with a rug tucked up
        and around her as warm and contented as a sleepy
        kitten.</p>

    <p>He talked of Germany, and world politics, and literature
        and pedagogy. When he drooped, she stirred him
        on.</p>

    <p>As they drew near Haverford he asked her a question
        about the games. She gave no answer. Propped
        in her corner, just beside the wrinkles made where the
        hood of the carriage is thrown back, she was having a
        contented, smiling slumber.</p>

    <p>He watched her as she slept, mused on her calms
        and her storms, speculated as to what sort of character
        was emerging. As they drew into the Club gateway,
        he touched her gently.</p>

    <p>“I have guarded thy couch, fair Titania,” he said;
        “I, Bottom, the weaver, have done that thing.”</p>

    <p>“Where’s Peaseblossom?” he took her cue quickly.</p>

    <p>Blynn jerked his thumb toward the diminutive Mac,
        who had now begun to stiffen up and look his smartest
        before the superior broughams in the lane about him.</p>

    <p>“Peaseblossom in ‘blacks,’” she gurgled. “Oh!
        oh! That is <i>too</i> funny!”</p>

    <p>“Topic number six,” he announced quietly. “I intend
        to take your advice about Holden. I’m going.”</p>

    <p>“When?”</p>

    <p>“October; next month.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>She pondered for a second or two and then nodded
        a determined head.</p>

    <p>“Good boy!” she patted him on the arm. “Bully!
        Now you’re talking like a grown-up man.”</p>

            A MORRIS DAY</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">ONLY a small gallery followed the tennis tournament.
        Although there were some splendid
        outside entries and the match took on the
        flavor of a semi-official eastern championship, the newspapers—according
        to Diccon—had not yet made
        tennis a sport. A magnificent cup, with some good
        names already on it, was the trophy; and the finals in
        singles, between Morris and Clarke, would decide the
        year’s holder.</p>

    <p>While Mac was engineering a good spot for the carriage,
        Gorgas scanned the players’ quarters for signs
        of Morris. Soon a white figure—“ducks,” white cap,
        open-throated shirt—waved in the distance and began
        to make toward them.</p>

    <p>“Allen Blynn,” Gorgas spoke quietly, “don’t you
        back-pedal for one minute on that Holden job.” It
        was the day of the bicycle. “You’ve won it according
        to the rules. You’ve just got to go. I’m mighty
        glad you’re thinking sensibly about it. Now, that’s all
        the time I can give you—the rest of the day belongs
        to Edwin Morris. Wish it were baseball, so we could
        root for him. Hello, boy, how are you feeling?”</p>

    <p>“Never better,” said the boy.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Morris tossed back a lock of hair as he came up
        smiling. Lithe, clean-looking suppleness he showed;
        shy almost; lounging; giving no sign of superior physical
        power; that unique creature, a new species, the
        American college-athlete.</p>

    <p>“You’re going to win, of course,” Gorgas searched
        his face admiringly.</p>

    <p>“The trouble is,” he drawled, “Clarke says he feels
        fit, too. We’ve agreed to let loose and give you a show
        for your penny.”</p>

    <p>Blynn inquired, “Forgive me, Edwin, for not knowing
        who Clarke is. He’s your friend, the enemy; is he
        not?”</p>

    <p>“Fancy not knowing Clarke, Hudson Clarke!”
        Gorgas looked at him in wonderment. “He’s the foxiest
        tenniser outside of dear old Lun’non. We’d be
        lucky to get his scalp, I tell you.”</p>

    <p>Her loyalty was immense. She filled Morris with
        the glow of success, keyed him up with little whispers of
        faith, and gave him something to fight for.</p>

    <p>On his white shirt the tiny fraternity brooch made
        a conspicuous mark. Gorgas reached over and carefully
        disengaged the patent fastening and, with equal
        care, pinned it upon her own proud new gown. Morris
        watched her without speaking. She gave it several
        little pats to see if it were secure and then talked into
        his right ear.</p>

    <p>“That’s for good luck.”</p>

    <p>“Going to keep it?” he grinned. He knew all about
        the significance of wearing a man’s fraternity pin.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“There’s never no telling. Mebbe; if you win.”</p>

    <p>“She’s rather savage, don’t you think?” Blynn
        leaned forward and rallied her. “Think how all
        Clarke’s little girls will feel if he loses.”</p>

    <p>“That’s their affair,” she shut her lips. “We’re
        after that cup, aren’t we, boy? When we play we go
        in hard; no quarter; divil take the hindmost. That’s
        the only way to play. Slash ’em, knock ’em over, go
        for ’em. I just hate the chap I’m playing against—until
        the game’s over.”</p>

    <p>“Contrariwise?” Morris jested.</p>

    <p>“<i>Sans doute</i>,” she patted him on the head, “until
        the game’s over.”</p>

    <p>They chatted together like chums, until the call came
        for the finals.</p>

    <p>To Blynn those two young persons seemed suddenly
        alien; it was his first sense of moving away from very
        young life. It comes to some men in the twenties
        and to others not until much later. One day you find
        yourself a stranger to the prattle about you; it may be
        you grow a little testy at its inanities, its silly repetitions
        and obvious repartee; or perhaps you try to
        join in, and find the youngsters combining to laugh at
        your clumsiness. Over there, smoking stolidly in the
        easy chairs, there is where you belong. You stare and
        figure out ages and discover to your consternation that
        you do belong over there. Then some old, old, lady to
        whom you feel like saying, “Yes, ma’am” and “No,
        ma’am”—if that was the salutation of your own day—comes
        burbling forward to claim you as a contemporary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
        And with the laughter of the children still
        in your ears, and half claiming your attention, you
        begin lamely to talk life insurance or the present administration’s
        foreign policy.</p>

    <p>After Morris had gone, Blynn felt very uncomfortable.
        He would have given much to be able to slip
        quietly out and get at his note-taking on Scot’s “Discoverie
        of Witchcraft”; or to have some member of his
        “contemporary club” stroll by and take a seat in the
        carriage. He didn’t know what to say to this strange
        young person before him; especially after he had witnessed
        the kind of prattle youth carries on nowadays.
        (Did he ever talk that way to girls? he wondered. He
        couldn’t remember—another sign of distance.)</p>

    <p>But, Gorgas was true to her word. The remainder
        of that day was given over to Edwin Morris. After
        all, tennis was her trade; she was looking on with a
        craftsman’s eye, catching the meaning of every serve
        and return.</p>

    <p>The first set was a battle. Both men kept to their
        agreement to wade in and give the small crowd an exhibition.
        Deuce games were frequent. After 4-3 in
        favor of Clarke, Morris’ serve evened it to 4-4. By
        a squeak it went to 5-4—Clarke had slipped to the
        ground in trying for an easy ball—and Morris took
        his own serve for the set: 6-4.</p>

    <p>Gorgas could hardly contain her joy. She applauded
        with little, rapid slaps upon her kid gloves and
        called to Blynn to help with the noise. Her gloves came
        ripping off so that she could make her allegiance heard.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Oh, that serve!” she chuckled. “It looks, oh, so
        easy; but it’s a fooler. He invented it and uses it only
        when he needs a point. It has hardly a bounce to it;
        just skims along the grass. Edwin! Edwin!” she
        talked but forebore calling. “We’re here!” When he
        glanced slowly over, grinning sheepishly as if he had
        done something wrong, she tugged at his fraternity
        brooch and made as if to wave it.</p>

    <p>In the second set Morris maintained the lead until
        5-4. It looked like both sets and the trophy, but
        Clarke let loose, as if mad, evened the score and tore
        through to 7-5 and set.</p>

    <p>It still had the appearance of a Morris day. Clarke
        was evidently winded and worn. He was strangely
        pale; the good-natured smile was rather fixed; but he
        stood up gamely for the third and final set.</p>

    <p>“You’ve got him, boy,” Gorgas murmured, just loud
        enough for Blynn. “Steady! Just keep her traveling....
        That’s the way! Let him put ’em out!...
        Make him work! He’s going down! See him breathe!...
        That’s the way! Play safe!... Whoopee!
        Did you see that ‘Lawford’?” And so on, straining
        and pulling with every smack of the ball.</p>

    <p>Clarke deliberately gave a game away, evidently to
        secure a rest. The score stood 4-2 in favor of Morris.
        They were changing courts, Morris with steady steps,
        Clarke with a drag. They said a few words as they
        passed the net. Clarke shook his head and dropped on
        one knee, ripped off the top lace of his shoe to adjust
        a white ankle brace. During the next game Clarke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
        barely stirred from one spot on the court; naturally,
        the score was with Morris at 5-2.</p>

    <p>Gorgas stopped her chatter. “Clarke put his ankle
        out when he slipped,” she told Blynn.</p>

    <p>“How do you know?” Blynn was aware of something
        strange in the playing. “He isn’t moving much,
        but he’s doing rather well, just now.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t you <i>see</i>?” she went on. “He’s all in.
        <i>Look</i> how white he is.... They ought to stop the
        game. It’s a pity!” She suffered in sympathy with
        every swing Clarke made to hold back defeat. “They
        oughtn’t to allow it.... Why doesn’t Edwin see he’s
        not trying for anything.”
    </p>

    <p>Then followed the absurdest bit of tennis that two
        really good players ever put up before spectators.
        Double faults were common; wide balls; missed shots
        that Blynn himself could have handled. Clarke was
        plainly given three games. Score 5-5.</p>

    <p>Once the men seemed to be disputing. Something
        that Morris said drove the smile from Clarke’s face, but
        not the pallor; and he came back for a few moments
        with his old-time form.</p>

    <p>“Good work!” Morris called. The score was
        Clarke’s at 6-5. It began suddenly to grow dark from
        a threatening storm.</p>

    <p>The men slackened again, each seeming to give way
        to the other. The shots were all going to the center
        of the court. No one seemed to be trying to get by
        the other. It was so amateurish that the men themselves
        occasionally laughed. Back and forth the ball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
        sailed peacefully—neither man budged—until, in the
        nature of things, it dropped into the net or went out
        of bounds. Two automatons, fixed near the back line,
        with power to lean and swing arms, that was the picture
        they presented. Nevertheless, under these absurd
        conditions, the men were playing with dogged earnestness.
        The game was desperately disputed, Clarke
        finally winning the set at 7-5, and with it, the trophy.</p>

    <p>“Tiddledywinks!” Gorgas summed up the game.
        “But glory be!” she turned a shining face to Blynn.
        “Wasn’t that the dandy thing to do? I’d not have
        spoken to him if he’d won that cup against a lame man.
        Look at Clarke. They’re carrying him off. He knows
        Ed let up. But, really, the way they played made it
        perfectly fair. It was anybody’s game. They might
        have spun a quarter for it.... And Neddie did so
        want to win.... He never said so; but I know. This
        is an awful swell cup, Allen Blynn. The winner always
        is somebody for a year, I tell you. Ed worked so hard
        to get in shape for this.... It’s a <i>darn</i> shame....
        Here! get out and take a walk and tell me when Ed
        comes with the tea-things. I’m g-going to—stay in
        here a-lone for a-while.... Get out! I tell you....
        Get out!”</p>

    <p>While Blynn drew up the carriage hood as a precaution
        against the coming shower, he could hear her
        quietly having her disappointment out in little diminishing
        sobs. He looked at the sky; both storms threatened
        to be over soon.</p>

    <p>Sprinkles of rain and Edwin with hot buttered muffins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
        and a tray full of cups appeared at the same time.</p>

    <p>“There’s plenty of tea and things,” he called merrily.
        “Everybody’s clearing out on account of the shower....
        Wait till I gather in a few more hot muffins.”</p>

    <p>Gorgas’ eyes followed him. He did not miss that;
        nor the whispered, “Fine work, old chap; we saw what
        you did.” But, characteristically, he said nothing
        about the game or its outcome.</p>

    <p>“Good sport, Clarke,” Morris said later, the nearest
        he came to discussing it. “Must have been ready to
        flop.... Cleaned me up in that second set; with a
        cracked ankle, too. Only thing to do—bring it on
        the level as near as possible. Seems a shame. Clarke
        didn’t want to win that way. Neither of us did.”</p>

    <p>During the brief shower, Gorgas mothered him,
        tucked the rug about him, fed him muffins, and decided
        just the proper color of tea for a hero. And then she
        insisted that he drive back with them.</p>

    <p>As Blynn thought of the spectacle of those two
        youngsters picnicking together, facing him all the way
        home, and talking their private jargon, he decided for
        the seat beside Mac.</p>

    <p>“Good work, Professor,” Morris laughed. “We
        don’t like to hurry you off, <i>but</i>—”</p>

    <p>The children seemed carried away by some unguessable
        joke.</p>

    <p>“What’s the matter?” Blynn beamed down on them
        benignly. “Is my tie jumping the track in back?”
        That was one of his constant fears. His right hand
        explored the neck.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Oh, your <i>back’s</i> all right,” Morris could hardly
        hold his joy at Blynn’s obtuseness. “<i>Back’s</i> fine!”
        Then he began to chant a college song of the hour,
        keeping time by rapid pats on his knees.</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">

    </div>

    <p>Blynn found Mac a contemporary. They talked of
        England’s treatment of Ireland, of the causes of immigration
        and what the world was coming to, anyway.
        It was good talk, grown-man’s fodder; while, back of
        them, the youngsters, tucked up in a rug, sang songs,
        comic and sentimental, flashed nonsense back and forth,
        recited absurd verse, and even hallooed to passersby.
        Bless our soul! Did we ever go through that stage?
        Perhaps. Then praise be to memory for forgetting all
        about it!</p>

    <p>Twilight found them ambling along the Wissahickon
        drive. In the woodland it was almost dark.</p>

    <p>“This ’ere Bardek,” Mac shook his head, “’e’s a
        funny feller.”</p>

    <p>“You’ve come to know him pretty well, I suppose,
        Mac,” prodded Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Ye-es,” Mac busied himself holding in the horses
        while they passed a returning “century run” of bicycles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
        each one with a different kind of bell and a different
        light. “Plagued bikes!—jes’ clutter up the road.
        No pleasure drivin’ no more.” After the main body
        had passed, the stragglers were easy to avoid. “Oh,
        he’s all right—I guess, but—well, he talks a lot, now;
        don’t he?”</p>

    <p>“His talk is rich,” said Blynn. “It has the charm
        of straight thinking, unbiased thinking. He’s travelled
        a great deal and is naturally observant. I don’t always
        agree with him, but I like his talk.”</p>

    <p>“Do y’ understan’ all he’s drivin’ at?” Mac seemed
        incredulous of anyone doing that. “An’ d’ y’ think
        he understan’s it ’isself?”</p>

    <p>Without waiting for an answer to his question, Mac
        went on:</p>

    <p>“Now, I don’t say I don’t like him, ’cause I do. He
        stands by Miss Gorgas, as if she might be his own
        daughter. That’s all right. But—” Mac glanced
        back furtively—“he gives me a lot o’ talk about marriage,
        which, as bein’ a respectable marri’d man, m’self,
        I’m not takin’ no stock in. Wimmen may be one thing,
        and wimmen may be another; but marri’d is marri’d—that’s
        my way o’ thinkin’. It’s the way I was brung
        up and I sticks to it. He’s got migh-ty funny notions
        about marriage—migh-ty funny. It’s my opinion,
        and it’s me wife’s opinion, that he ain’t never marri’d
        to th’t little woman in the glen. Mind, I’m not asayin’
        it is nor it taint so. All that I know is ’e don’t believe
        much in marriage. Dangerous character, I call
        ’im; but, I do like to have ’im aroun’.... Why, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
        don’t believe in property, nor money, nor the church nor
        nothin’. He says he thinks God is interested in gnats
        and horseflies! Think o’ that, now!... I was pullin’
        up weeds in the garden once, and he looked at me and
        laughed. ‘Why you change all God’s plans for, you
        ol’ Mac?’ he sez. ‘Takes a lot o’ time to make nice
        clean weed. You don’t like the way the Lord made the
        earth, eh? In six day,’ he sez, ‘the Lord created
        heaven and earth and all that therein is, and ol’ Mac
        he spend all his life pullin’ it up and makin’ it better.
        An’ w’at you grow?’ he sez. ‘Ugh! tomat! ugh! Gott,’
        he sez, ‘spoil ni-ce fre-sh weed for ol’ tomat! ugh!’ and
        he makes faces and waves ’is hands.... Now, w’at
        you agoin’ to do with a feller like that?”</p>

    <p>“Don’t do anything,” laughed Blynn. “Just enjoy
        him.”</p>

    <p>“An’ he’s a anarchist, too,” Mac’s head shook very
        dolefully at that. “Sez he is, ’imself. Sez he’s as
        much anarchist as anything. That’s purt-ty bad, Mr.
        Blynn. Herr Most and all them Chicago fellers! Um!
        An’ y’ can’t help likin’ ’im! I’d do almost anything
        for Bardek—think o’ that, now!—most anything—I
        hev already lied for him!—think o’ that, now, him
        as good as an anarchist and me a respectable marri’d
        man!”</p>

    <p>Out of the dark of Cresheim road came a sonorous
        voice. It was far off, moving toward them. The song
        was evidently improvised, both words and music. The
        refrain, which had been more carefully worked up, came
        clear across the night.</p>

    <p>(“Cows” rhymed perfectly with “house.”)</p>

    <p>The singer sighted the dull lamps of the carriage
        and shouted a mighty “Whoo-ee!” which was answered
        quickly by Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“I haf moved from one t’ousand B. C. straight—plumpf!—into
        the nineteen century.” Bardek bobbed
        up before them, but Bardek with waving mustachio
        gone, Bardek shaved and hair-cutted, Bardek in new
        soft hat, rolling low collar and a roomy new suit of
        clothes! He was quite resplendent and stunning, but
        outwardly a brand new Bardek.</p>

    <p>“<i>Presto!</i> I jump into respectables,” he bowed.
        “My family is moved. They have all said the prayers
        and skipped to sleep. Ah! Ol’ Mac, you are no more
        to be the on’y respectable married man in all America.”</p>

    <p>With laughter they helped him into the carriage.</p>

    <p>“I give my wife and kiddies one gran’ scare. They
        t’ink I am some strange feller, till I talk—ah! Who
        talk like Bardek! In six languages I prove myself.
        So! I gif up liberty an’ become American slave. In
        America all men are slave to women and children.
        <i>Freiheit, adië!</i>”
    </p>

    <p>Questions brought out the fact that he had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
        possession of the white cottage, moved his family in—to
        the great joy of the children—and had marched
        off to the nearest barber and then to the nearest clothing
        store.</p>

    <p>“I say to the barber, ‘Make me like American!’
        He say, ‘It cost you much—one-half dollar!’ I say,
        ‘Here is one <i>whole</i> dollar. This is a big job; don’t
        do it <i>half</i>!’ Then he clip, clip, clip, but I say nothings.
        ‘Americans wear the “clean face,”’ he stop and
        say. I say, ‘I <i>talk</i> vairy well myself; <i>do</i>!’ I t’ink
        with ‘clean face’ he means wash it; but hoh! he mean
        ‘cut it off!’ So I learn some new English and look
        like a fat, little, stupid priest, eh, Mac? We go to
        mass, Sunday, eh, ol’ Mac? But not confession! <i>Ach,
            du lieber Gott!</i> When I tell all my little sins it would
        be Sunday again! How you like me, eh?”</p>

    <p>It was hard to get used to the new Bardek; the vagabond
        had made way for a distinguished foreigner.
        They discovered, in looking him over, that it was the
        sweeping mustachio which gave him the appearance of
        desperado. The broad forehead, the deep eyes, the
        great nose, the laughing lips and the huge chin were
        well worth exposing. It was like the transformation
        wrought when campers come out of the woods, quite
        undistinguishable from the native guides, and, after one
        hour’s refurbishing and barbering, become gentlemen.
        There would be no doubt, thought Blynn, of a welcome
        for Bardek at the Leverings.</p>

    <p>“It is a good feeling,” Bardek stroked his newly
        shorn face. “My skin has changed into American. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
        cannot yet spit, but, if I try—mebbe.... The wife,
        oh, she run all t’rough the rooms, and the children, too;
        and they laugh and fall on the floor and laugh. They
        go out to breathe and come in and stay as long as they
        can—<i>La porte fermée</i>. Good air <i>adië</i>—like sea diver—till
        I open windows. We go to store and buy broom
        and bed and—everything. In little while, we fix
        things. Wife, she go to Mac’s house and peek in window
        to see where bed go—she on’y little girl when I
        take her. An’ good Mrs. Mac, she come over and laugh
        and they all laugh. We all so silly. Then, Mrs. Mac,
        she change everything different, while she near die
        laughing. We have bed in the kitchen, she say, and
        stoves in the yard with the pump. But, Mrs. Mac she
        fix all. And how we work! Ach! My bones hurt.
        We are vairy grand. <i>Ma foi!</i> My wife, she cry and
        say she afraid. The bed go c-r-r-eck, cr-r-eck, and go
        down, down, down. But she vairy tired and she sleep.
        Then I go out and pull door-bell. <i>Là! là! là! là!</i> I
        wait, holdin’ in big laugh. I think I see whole dam’
        business come crying for the devils have come to get
        t’em. I wait. I hold my laugh back. I ring loud.
        So! Schwurunkl-angl-unkl-angl-angle! All so still. I
        go up the crooked steps—some day I break my neck,
        there!—<i>V’là!</i> Sleep like dead.... Me! Wah-oo-eep!”
        he yawned. “I sleep stan’ up.”</p>

    <p>He began a second, healthy, out-in-the-woods yawn,
        which extended amid comfortable “ah’s” and “oh’s”
        and “ee’s” until it snapped back in ecstatic relief.</p>

    <p>“Oh-wo-wo-wo!” imitated Gorgas. “You’ve ow!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
        wow! got me go-ow-ing too, Bardek. I’m so-ow-oh
        slee-py.”</p>

    <p>Everyone yawned. Bardek outdid himself. Mac
        nearly dislocated his jaw.</p>

    <p>In a moment or two Bardek was put down at his
        “boards and plaster,” and Gorgas, Blynn and Morris
        were saying farewells.</p>

    <p>“My pin,” Morris was holding out a hand.</p>

    <p>“I think I’ll keep it,” she pushed his hand aside.
        “You deserve something for today’s work. You were
        <i>great</i>, boy; simply great!”
    </p>

    <p>Morris said his goodbys quickly and was off to catch
        a town train.</p>

    <p>“And, now, Mr. Professor,” Gorgas turned to Blynn,
        “I’m going to write to you when you arrive at Holden,
        and if you don’t answer within five days—I’ll—”</p>

    <p>“What will you do, child?”</p>

    <p>She looked at him steadily. Smiles and little frowns
        came and went, like gust ripples on a pond.</p>

    <p>“Don’t ever put a girl through that sort of thing
        again. You don’t know what it is to be eaten up with
        shame—every day, too, for months and months.
        Well! We’ve dropped that; haven’t we? But I’m
        still a little hot about it.... Good night, Allen Blynn
        ... and good luck to you ... and remember; don’t
        back-pedal.”</p>

    <p>“Good night, I’m on my mettle,” he tried her old
        rhyming game, as he walked away.</p>

    <p>“And answer letters,” she retorted, and added, “or
        with Gorgas Levering you’ll have to settle.”</p>

            THE LADY OF THE INTERRUPTION</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">SHE wrote to him at regular intervals, and he answered
        dutifully. To him they were the little
        letters of a lost child; not entirely lost, for much
        of the child was in her scrawling notes. With many
        persons the written word is much more intelligent than
        the oral; but with Gorgas Levering, who in a chat would
        easily give the impression of the grown woman, letter-writing
        exhibited a youngster still in the teens.</p>

    <p>She did not seem to know what to say; one wonders
        why she wrote; indeed, half of the letter would be announcements
        of why she could not write. And the
        spelling! For a young lady who spoke and read
        fluently in four languages, that spelling was inexplicable.</p>

    <p>Once Blynn sent back a letter with all the misspelled
        words underscored in red ink, and with the fatherly
        suggestion that she look them up and send him a re-written
        copy.</p>

    <p>Her answer was a shocker; every word was purposely
        put out of gear.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“Deer Proffessorr,” it ran. “Eye kannott korresspponndd
            eney longerr wwithh U.</p>

        <p>“Wun: U R 2 smarrt,</p>

        <p class="right">“Ewers, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

            “<span class="smcap">Goargass</span>.”
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>But she tried. Evidence was abundant enough. All
        suspicious words were left either totally blank or half-begun,
        to be finished out laboriously later via a small
        dictionary. The dictionary was not always employed
        immediately—her letters were regularly written at the
        sleepiest hour of the night; so that Blynn had the greatest
        joy in seeing dozens of hard words, like “disappoint”
        and “necessary,” flaring at him in two different
        kinds of ink, black for the first half and pale blue
        for the tails. His prize-letter—which he did not dare
        twit her about, for fear the supply would suddenly
        cease—was a mysterious thing, full of beginnings and
        no tails at all! Evidently sleep had overtaken the dictionary
        benediction.</p>

    <p>In their correspondence during the first college terms
        at Holden, while she was growing from sixteen to almost
        eighteen, there was hardly a personal note struck. One
        would not suspect that they had ever been acquainted.
        Hers resembled school exercises more than anything
        else, full of incoherent announcements of local news.
        His, on the other hand, were short stories of Holden
        life; gathered together they might have been published
        as the personal impressions of Professor Blynn on the
        manners and customs of Holdonians. They were brisk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
        sprightly narratives, rather longish, for he dictated
        them to a by-the-hour stenographer, but rich in personal
        flavor and really interesting. The Levering family
        read them in turn as they might have passed on the
        numbers of a serial story.</p>

    <p>From Gorgas, Allen knew that his letters were public
        property. That may have had some effect upon their
        construction and style; certainly, they grew in finished
        form and came to lend themselves easily to public family
        reading.</p>

    <p>But none of the matters that troubled him, nor any
        of his pedagogic dreams or literary ambitions found
        their way into these chatty epistles. It was a selected,
        semi-impersonal college world that he sorted out and
        presented to the Levering family; but a real one, for
        all that.</p>

    <p>Through these newsletters Gorgas knew that he had
        been lured by the siren of the lecture platform—always
        lying in wait for talkative young professors.
        Diccon saw to it that every public utterance of the
        distinguished young scholar who had been called to the
        chair of English in Holden College should be properly
        placed before the readers of the city newspapers. It
        worried Blynn, to be sure, to find his casual illustration
        made the subject of “small-heads”—there is nothing
        more frightful to sincere teachers than this sort of
        up-side-down publicity—but he solaced himself by
        hoping no one would see it.</p>

    <p>In Mount Airy Gorgas Levering was searching every
        page for such notices and was happy to get even a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
        three-line flyer just above the obituaries; and she cut
        them out and pasted them in a scrap-book. She felt
        responsible for his going to Holden, she assured herself,
        and she developed an I-told-you-so spirit with every
        discovery of what she believed to be proper fame.
        “Professor Allen Blynn, head of the division of English
        of Holden College, also spoke,” was often sufficient
        proof to her of her wisdom in advising him to go up to
        the larger work.</p>

    <p>She learned, too, of other matters, his phenomenal
        success in teaching his young children by way of correspondence,
        his pedagogic reforms in the administration
        at Holden, all of which she mused over with something
        akin to maternal calm; but one day his letter broke
        forth with the discovery of a “lady,” and Gorgas grew
        apprehensive and suspicious and on guard.</p>

    <p>“My dear Leverings,” he wrote. “Here’s Mystery
        for you! And a Lady! And local newspaper notoriety—not
        yet scandalous!”</p>

    <p>He had been lecturing before the Alpha Women’s
        Club on “The Dull Pleasures of the Mob.” It was one
        of those defenses of the intellectual life which every
        enthusiastic scholar is prepared to utter at a moment’s
        notice. The intellectual audience were proud of him;
        they applauded every one of his clever shafts as justification
        for their life of charming indolence. Then he
        forgot himself and inquired:</p>

    <p>“Is there any question on that point?”</p>

    <p>That was an absent-minded schoolroom phrase.</p>

    <p>“Yes; there is a question on that point,” came a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
        strong pleasant voice from the extreme end of the hall.
        He could not at first discern the lady, for she did not
        rise. “Do you really believe all this twaddle you are
        giving us, or are you just ‘parroting’ from a book?”</p>

    <p>The very young ladies laughed gayly. The rascals!
        They had been taking notes on all his golden utterances;
        yet they turned in glee to search out the rebellious questionist.
        The elders buzzed their horror; but they, too,
        squirmed about, curious to behold the cause of so inhospitable
        an interruption.</p>

    <p>“Oh, never mind,” the voice boomed out patiently.
        “It’s a hopeless thing to ask anyone.”</p>

    <p>She arose to go. Everyone could see the commanding
        figure and the perfect smile of good nature which
        half atoned for the rather shocking speech.</p>

    <p>“Go on, little man,” she nodded. “You’re giving
        them what they want, I suppose”—waving an arm
        over the audience—“or what they are trained to believe
        they want. Perhaps they deserve it,” she laughed.
        “But I’m a little sorry for you”; she turned to the
        speaker directly, as she gathered up her belongings;
        “you look like the sort who could do better—with a
        little honest tutoring.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t go, my dear lady, I beg of you,” Blynn called
        after her. Lecturers soon get used to eccentric debaters
        from the floor; although this one was decidedly
        of uncommon mould. She stopped at the door.
        “Please come back—let us reason together. If you
        don’t mind, I don’t. You can’t imagine what a great
        relief it is to get an interruption.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>She watched Blynn good naturedly, wavering between
        the desire to speak and the feeling of the futility
        of saying anything.</p>

    <p>Blynn went on coaxingly.</p>

    <p>“You stir my male curiosity deeply. All my life I
        have been respected and revered, treated like a special
        shipment of something valuable. You cannot know
        how lonely I have been. Why, even my students respect
        me.”</p>

    <p>She wavered. Already she had dropped her muff
        into a rear seat.</p>

    <p>“I can’t tell you how eager I am to be exposed,”
        Blynn smiled engagingly and waved a welcoming hand.
        “Do come back and let us dispute as did Plato and his
        friends; amicably, if possible, but always in the name
        of high truth.... You were saying, O Unknown
        One.”</p>

    <p>“I was saying what was in my mind, O Knowing
        One,” she replied. “But I am sorry now that I spoke.
        Your question seemed to touch a spring—the spring
        of ‘high truth.’ High truth, I fear, is a rude, uncivilized
        thing—most of us keep it thoroughly well guarded—I
        apologize for employing it here. But—” she fastened
        him with her motherly smile, “please don’t talk
        so confidently of the dull pleasures of the mob. Perhaps,
        as you suggest, Browning and Swinburne touch
        only the ultra-violet mind; talk about that, it is within
        your sphere; but until you know more about people, let
        the mob alone. To know the secret you have to be a
        mob yourself.... Forgive me for talking straight out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
        Professor. It is an uncultivated thing to do, I know;
        but it is right in the spirit of the mob, one of its dull
        pleasures.... I must go.... If I stay I’ll break
        out, and then someone would have to read me the riot
        act.... You’re a first-rate book, Professor; I should
        enjoy you—on a shelf; but you have never really
        <i>been</i>. Goodby.”
    </p>

    <p>Of course Blynn turned the event to account and
        made several quick epigrams out of the affair.</p>

    <p>“The audience cheered my little sallies,” he wrote,
        “which I accepted as proof of their regard—a vote of
        confidence, as it were, after a thundering attack from
        the opposition. Everyone apologized and told me that
        I had handled the situation with proper urbanity. No
        one seems to know her. She is not a member of the
        Alpha Women’s Club. But I’m glad she spoke out; to
        tell the truth, my dull lecture was boring even me!”</p>

    <p>The newspapers got a story out of the interruption;
        and for a nine-days the cartoonist played up professors
        and “the dull pleasures of the mob.” One of the hits
        in a touring musical comedy company had its source
        here.</p>

    <p>“Are you happy, Mike?”</p>

    <p>“Sure, perfesser, I’m happy; ain’t I got a headache!”</p>

    <p>Gorgas wrote a single sentence of disapproval of the
        lady’s rudeness and in postscript inquired, “How old
        is she?”</p>

    <p>And Blynn came back with an imitation of the laconic
        note.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Dear Gorgas: She was not rude, but enchanting.</p>

        <p>“P. S. She is as old as truth, which is ever young
            and beautiful.”</p>
    </div>

    <p>The “Lady” came in for occasional notice in nearly
        every letter. “The ‘Interruption,’” he wrote, “has
        had a disturbing effect on me. Somehow between my
        audiences and myself the phantom smile of the unknown
        mocks me, although I haven’t seen her again. When I
        speak confidently out of my store of book-knowledge
        the smile seems to broaden into a grin; but when I quote
        Aristotle or Plato, it positively laughs in derision.”</p>

    <p>In public, he explained, he had come to be consciously
        on the defensive. He began to avoid book authorities
        and seek illustration from his slender personal experience
        of men and things. Occasionally she drove him
        to take off his glasses and look about him. In his off
        hours, instead of burrowing in the library, he walked
        about the streets and observed the throngs. He wandered
        along the aisles of department stores, chatted
        with policemen, and elbowed workmen in the trolley
        cars; sat in the public squares and talked with the old
        men who sun themselves there daily, and with the youngish
        tramps, down at the heel and beery.</p>

    <p>Once he had wandered on a wharf where excursionists
        were about to embark for a brief trip down the
        river. A rosy mother was struggling with a huge picnic
        basket and a medley of children. She let him help
        her with the next youngest baby, while the husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
        with two toddlers was surging ahead to secure a good
        seat. Before Blynn had quite made up his mind what
        to do next, the boat had slid off into the stream and he
        was in for a first-hand experience of the “dull pleasures
        of the mob.”</p>

    <p>It was pleasure, he had to admit some hours later,
        but by no means dull. He exhausted all the slot devices
        for chewing gum and chocolate, weighed the
        kiddies on all the machines, invested wholesale in
        lemonade and bananas, and actually waltzed to the
        strains of a harp and one violin. At Houston Park
        they swooped down upon the carrousel, captured places
        on the scenic railway by vulgar bribery, and eventually
        “set ’em up” to a dessert of “hoky-poky” ice cream,
        as part-payment for a share of the basket lunch.</p>

    <p>The young husband permitted all this gallantry without
        surprise. Indeed, in the twilight trip homeward
        Blynn and he sat together in the stern of the boat and
        smoked out a fine friendship—one exhausted kiddie
        asleep content in the professor’s arms—and there it
        was he paid Blynn the fine compliment of inquiring
        where he “worked.”</p>

    <p>“At Holden College,” Blynn replied, guiltily waving
        a hand in a vague professional manner, the which his
        companion seemed to take as the motions of mopping a
        floor.</p>

    <p>“Purdy soft, hey?” he grinned.</p>

    <p>“Tolerable,” said Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Women do all the scrubbin’,” he volunteered.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Aye, and they do it well,” Blynn told him.</p>

    <p>“An’ all summer nothin’ to do at all!” he mused.
        “Purdy soft! Purdy soft!”</p>

    <p>He looked at Blynn proudly, as if the securing of
        such a sinecure was in itself a worthy act.</p>

    <p>“I express for Hamilton’s,” he confided. “Furniture
        vans,” he added in answer to an inquiring look.
        “Some days we jess ‘move,’ but most times we hussels
        pianos. Y’back feels it nights, I tell y’. But, y’ sleeps
        good.”</p>

    <p>“Ah!” Blynn said. “I envy you there. I don’t
        ‘sleep good’ at all. Half the night I lie awake thinking
        of foolish unnecessary things.”</p>

    <p>“Y’ ain’t got no work to do!” the expressman spoke
        with emphasis. “It’ll give any man the bug-eye.
        What you want is a reg-u-lar job. What you’re
        a-doin’, that’s a woman’s business. Oh, I’ve tried my
        hand at cinches—grass cutting, drivin’ a wagon, takin’
        the dog out walkin’. Made me sick. I got to put <i>guts</i>
        in my job. That’s what <i>you</i> need—a job y’ got to put
        <i>guts</i> in.”
    </p>

    <p>As the talk grew confidential at parting he let the
        professor lend him five dollars without the shadow of a
        protest. There was nothing squeamish, self-conscious
        or over-modest about the expressman. “Sure!” he
        said and pocketed the bill without more ado. He
        treated Blynn so like an equal that the university man
        stalked off elated as if he had just been admitted to an
        exclusive fraternity.</p>

    <p>It was through such wild adventures that Blynn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
        graduated to a deed of daring. One cool, spring Saturday
        night found him strolling along the badly lighted
        streets of a section known as “The Ditch.” The
        swinging doors of an odorous “saloon,” backed by a
        glaring warm light, which made the dark street a shade
        dimmer, seemed to bid a “Welcome All!” He went
        in.</p>

    <p>The faces of the lounging drinkers at the bar were
        worth many times the small admission fee, the price of a
        strangling glass of ginger ale. They were like
        characters in a modern Morality Play, Blynn thought,
        as he named them in order: “Simple,” thin nose,
        hanging lip and lack-lustre eye; “Low-brow,” a rogue
        by right of inheritance; “Toothless,” a boy with the
        face of a crone; “Evil,” selfish to the point of cruelty;
        “Braggart,” serious and self-contemplative; “Sloth,”
        simply fat.</p>

    <p>Speech was gone to a mumble; cackles of laughter
        arose over nothing at all; futile drivel slavered from
        the chin.</p>

    <p>“’S my treat—godda drink ’th me!” fumbled
        “Simple,” displaying a bill.</p>

    <p>The well-groomed barkeep and owner swept it off
        into his resplendent cash-register and began the swift
        passing out of the accustomed drinks. Blynn’s second
        ginger ale was slid beside him before he could guess the
        meaning of the action.</p>

    <p>And so treating went the rounds. Here and there
        pay-envelopes were opened and tossed on the counter
        with bravado. To Blynn’s amazement the alert barkeep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
        boldly kept the change of those who were too far
        gone to protest. When “Evil” called blasphemously
        for his money the barkeep roared with delight and spun
        the coins out from behind a concealed glass.</p>

    <p>“Thought I’d got you that time, Pete!” he shouted
        gayly.</p>

    <p>No one seemed to notice that Blynn’s pile of ginger
        ale was untouched. He had resolved not to be a party
        to the disgusting custom. So he was about to pay his
        little bill and depart, when an almost inarticulate soliloquy
        from “Evil,” the least sodden of the lot, stopped
        him short and sent his head aflaming.</p>

    <p>“Wife’s sick ’gin, dam ’er. <i>Tol’</i> ’er, break ’er head.
        <i>Will</i> break ’er head w’enna g’ home. Las’ night—las’
        night—’noth’ dam brat.... Allus havin’ dam brats....
        Locked ’er up; ’did. Tol’ ’er, break ’er head.
        <i>Will</i> break ’er head w’enna g’ home.”
    </p>

    <p>He went on with this maudlin talk, to which no one attended.
        Ordinarily, Allen Blynn looked on the miseries
        of the poor with a mild professorial eye. The world
        is a horrible place for some folks, “a darkling plain
        where ignorant armies clash by night”; no remedy is
        nigh; we must sigh in pity and pass on to our own compelling
        tasks.</p>

    <p>But this fellow’s story, which he enlarged upon until
        there was no doubt of his meaning, Blynn viewed in no
        spirit of philosophic calm. Perhaps the alcoholic air
        of the place had got into his vitals, and had stirred
        them; perhaps that hidden, scourging priest within him
        had broken forth to battle with the evil one; perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
        Lady had made him realize that he lacked something of
        being a man: at any rate, he strode up back of that villainous
        beer-sop and spun him about so that his back
        leaned at an angle against the bar and his feet spread
        out in front of him.</p>

    <p>“Where do you live?” Blynn darted the question at
        him so fiercely that he answered automatically.</p>

    <p>“Twenty-six Hogan street,” he growled, then slid
        heavily and sat down in the gutter before the bar.
        From this posture he hurled weak curses.</p>

    <p>The barkeep leaped adroitly across the bar, shoved
        Blynn aside with, “Here you! Get out o’ this.
        Tryin’ to start somethin’?” while he jerked his customer
        to normal human posture.</p>

    <p>“Evil” reached for a glass and hurled it at random.
        The shot slid him down again into the gutter; the glass
        fell wide with a glorious crash. “Low-brow” seized
        a bottle, but was too weak to hold it. It slipped to
        the floor, almost an echo of the other smash. “Simple”
        came up behind, with only the friendliest intentions, no
        doubt, and put one beery arm about the professor’s
        shoulder. Blynn turned swiftly at the heavy touch and
        embraced him—without love, one may be sure—thereby
        projecting upon his shirtfront the full contents
        of that beer-mug, a cavernous vessel holding, at least, a
        quart. The vile odor was a lasting memory.</p>

    <p>The embrace had been a clumsy thing, but the divorce
        was swift and artistic. As Blynn instinctively shoved
        “Simple” forward—the cold beer against the chest
        gave impetus to the push—the barkeep’s grip on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
        “Simple’s” collar sent him spilling backward. On the
        way he carried “Toothless” with him. “Sloth” never
        even looked around; he leaned comfortably against the
        bar and mumbled in his beer.</p>

    <p>All these movements Blynn watched with interested
        eyes, caught every sound as if it were data for a book.
        One-half of his mind was a spectator, cool, undisturbed,
        careless of the outcome, concerned only with the spectacle;
        the other was saying over and over again, “26
        Hogan street! 26 Hogan street!” and it was throbbing
        with rage.</p>

    <p>“Here’s my money for one glass of ginger ale,”
        Blynn confronted the barkeep. “And I want my
        change—all of it, do you hear! You’ve robbed every
        drunken sot in the room except that vile cur,” pointing
        to “Evil” still sprawling in the gutter before the bar.
        “I’ve seen you steal their money out of their pay-envelopes.
        Give me my change, you viper!” He
        slapped a twenty-five cent piece on the sopping counter.
        “Give me my change, you bloodsucker, you poisoner,
        you—”</p>

    <p>“Git out!” the barkeep yelled as he rushed at him.
        “Git out!”</p>

    <p>He yelled much more. He told Blynn things concerning
        his past that were biologically impossible and
        made prophetic assertions about the future. His
        speeches were wild enough but his actions were genuinely
        savage. Before Blynn could get into any proper pugilistic
        position the barkeep had welted him across the
        side of the head with a huge fist.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>The Lady had called him a first-rate book! A book?
        Not much!</p>

    <p>It would be a pleasant thing to say here that Allen
        Blynn had trained in his youth with a football team
        or that he had taken recent boxing lessons from Corbett’s
        sparring partner. The truth is that his physical
        condition was only that of an abstemious “professor”
        the spry side of thirty, who jogged daily about the gymnasium
        track, or pulled a few perfunctory chest-weights,
        just to give edge to the evening meal. But that unexpected
        blow on the side of the head maddened him and
        summoned triple strength.</p>

    <p>In one spring he had that barkeep by the throat and
        had carried him to the floor over the sprawling legs of
        “Simple.” Seizing him by his flap ears he was fiercely
        pounding his head against the floor, when he found himself
        lifted in the air by two bluecoats, turned about and
        sent forward at a fearful angle, through the swing-doors,
        into the darkened alley of a street. As he went
        out someone smashed the side of his head with a bottle,
        and he always maintained the theory that an officer near
        the door had assisted accurately with a boot; but his
        greatest joy as he sprawled on the pavement was the
        feeling—later discovered to be an illusion—that he
        still held in his hands the remains of the barkeep’s ears.</p>

    <p>On the way to 26 Hogan street he laughed and sang
        and exulted in strange words. Before his mind he summoned
        the barkeep and that Satan’s limb, “Evil,” and
        invited them to “Come on!” Names he called them,
        mouthfilling, rhythmic cadences; anathema that never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
        had been in his vocabulary before, but which every man
        who has mingled with other men knows by instinct.</p>

    <p>And she had called him a book!</p>

    <p>By ’phone and messenger, help was brought to “26
        Hogan street.” They broke in the locked door, conveyed
        the sick woman to the care of good nurses, clean
        linen and real food. Her little brood they kept with
        her, and so, in this one instance out of many, lightened
        the dark hours of the very poor. Blynn confessed
        with shame that before this experience he had not really
        known of their existence.</p>

    <p>Soon after the groggery episode Professor Blynn
        was scheduled for a banquet speech at the annual meeting
        of a local Drama Club. The subject, selected long
        before, was “Realism in Modern Dramatic Art and the
        Decadence of True Fantasy.” Certain notes which he
        had put lovingly together for that evening were not
        at all consulted as he talked. The musty references to
        Freytag, Horace, and Boileau did not suit his mood.
        He could not get out of his mind some of the stirring
        realities of the life about him; so, casually, and without
        any deep professional manner, he talked of the material
        near at hand out of which great dramas might come.
        He drew on his most recent stores. For stage setting
        he proferred the blinking steamboats on the dark river,
        crowded with returning excursionists, and humming
        with harp and violin; for characters, “Simple,” “Low-brow,”
        “Evil,” “Toothless,” “Braggart,” “Sloth”;
        and for theme, The Birth of New Life in the Houses
        of Failure.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>The newspaper boys were bent on putting him back
        on the first page—he grinned inwardly at the story
        he really could give them! That is why they condensed
        the remarks of really important speakers and put Allen
        Blynn forth almost verbatim.</p>

    <p>Out of it all he got one dubious result, a letter.</p>

    <p>“You are getting on, my dear Professor,” it began
        abruptly, without heading or date line. “You are no
        longer a <i>book</i>; you have developed into a <i>newspaper</i>.
        Eventually, you may become wholly human. Press on.”</p>

    <p>It was signed, “The Lady of the Interruption,” a
        title he remembered he had given her when reporters
        had interviewed him about her on her first startling appearance.</p>

    <p>At various times these and other exciting adventures
        were dictated to the impersonal stenographer-by-the-hour
        and mailed to the Levering family.</p>

    <p>“The anonymity of the Lady distresses me,” he
        wrote once. “If I could put my whole case before her,
        I am sure she would give me a higher rating. For already
        one of my friends of the Public Square benches
        has found me out and successfully negotiated the loan
        of a dollar. Let someone try to get an unearned dollar
        out of any ‘newspaper.’”</p>

    <p>And that was not all. His companion of the excursion
        steamer—the male—had caught him on the
        campus, where no doubt he had been lying in wait, and
        had sold him tickets for the annual Expressmen’s Ball.</p>

    <p>“Perfes’r—” he began.</p>

    <p>“But I am the janitor; am I not?” Blynn smiled.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Am I not!” he mimicked, “‘Am-I-not’ ain’t never
        been no janitor.... ‘Am I not!’” he got a deal of
        amusement out of the phrase. “Knew y’ was a profess’r
        all the time. Wharf watchman tol’ me. Said
        you was a smart gab-fester, too. He’s heard you—a
        Socialist, he is.”</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“Lately,” wrote Blynn, “he has been seeking my advice
            on a number of family matters, leading up to hints
            for loans. An unkempt, overgrown daughter came to
            my rooms yesterday with a note. I was stone-cold; but
            it almost made me ill.</p>

        <p>“And now ‘Evil’ has found me out. He objects at
            the hospital because of my card on a bunch of roses;
            and threatens to sue me for personal assault; I presume
            he will complete the charge by adding alienation of his
            wife’s affections! A book I may have been, raised
            thence to a daily journal, but, Leverings all, I appeal to
            you for promotion; assault and alienation are right human
            qualities.</p>

        <p class="right">“Faithfully yours, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            “Allen Blynn.
        </p>

        <p>“I am on the trail of the Lady.”</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Leverings agreed that the “Lady of the Interruption”
        was a delightful mystery—all except Gorgas;
        but she said little at home. She put the case to
        Bea Wilcox, and to Bardek.</p>

    <p>“What do I think of her?” Bea echoed her inquiry.
        “I think she’s no lady at all.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“That’s what I think. I—” Gorgas began eagerly.</p>

    <p>“I think she’s a Brass Image,” said Bea.</p>

    <p>“It is so!” Bardek agreed solemnly, who knew
        nothing of the subtile English meanings of “brass.”
        “And it is before such images that men do often bow
        in worship. If she is young, as you say, and if she come
        to the man and fight him, then it is the female hunting
        the male for herself.”</p>

    <p>“What <i>are</i> you driving at, Bardek?” Bea broke in.
        “Females, as you call them, don’t hunt males. It’s the
        other way about.” She put her arm around Gorgas
        and rocked back and forth in a characteristic attitude.
        “We know—us girls know—don’t we, Browny?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes!” Bardek had open contempt for Bea’s
        mind. “You talk like most peoples who do not see anything.
        Look at all the hats of women! Dead birds
        and painted flowers and rags and wires! Ugly?
        Phuh! But zey do not see zat zey are ugly. So!
        When you will want your man, you will go to him—like
        all t’others—and you cry out to him that you are
        here; and he will not come at first; and zen you will
        wear crazy clothes, and dance and beat a drum until he
        must see you. And all the time you will not know that
        you do that. You will not see.... But <i>how</i> you will
        beat zat drum!”</p>

    <p>“Professor Blynn would not listen to her!” Gorgas
        announced irrelevantly. Her mind was on the Lady of
        the Interruption; there was defiance in her tone, a note
        of challenge to the unknown trespasser, none of which
        was lost on Bardek. He shaded his bushy brows a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
        trifle, and he gazed thoughtfully into her flushed face as
        if he had suddenly discovered something new and interesting
        there; but he gave no other sign of what might
        be his own surmises.</p>

    <p>“Do you think so, Bardek?” she persisted.</p>

    <p>“No-o,” he hesitated; “not at the first.” A smile
        began to flutter across his face; then he roared in sudden
        laughter. “He is so far up—at the top of the
        Heaven! <i>How</i> she must beat her little drum for to
        make Saint Acetum to hear!”</p>

    <p>“Who is Saint Acetum?” both girls asked.</p>

    <p>Bardek sobered abruptly. “You do not know
        Saint Acetum?” he asked gravely.</p>

    <p>No; they did not know. Saints were not in fashion
        any more. This is not the Middle Ages, Bardek. But
        they should be ashamed, nevertheless, he told them, and
        scolded beautifully. Then he explained:</p>

    <p>“Saint Acetum it is who is forever repairing ze roof
        of ze Heaven. Can you not see him up there—far
        superior in altitude to all the angels of Heaven, and
        slowly feeling zat he <i>is</i> superior?”</p>

    <p>But what had Saint Acetum to do with Mr. Blynn?</p>

    <p>“Ho!” cried Bardek. “Mr. Blynn, he is so good!
        Like Saint Acetum he is worried zat ze roof of ze
        Heaven may fall down; so it is zat he is always fixing,
        fixing; and he will not listen even when ze good angels
        call to come down and be for a little time happy....
        And you have not heard of Saint Acetum? <i>Nom du
            nom!</i> And you are not ashamed of zat?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Acetum?” repeated Bea. “What a funny name.”</p>

    <p>“‘Acetum,’ it is ‘vinegar,’” Bardek explained.
        “Zat is Latin, Miss Bea, of which you know nothings,
        because you have gone to school—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, we had Latin in school; didn’t we, Browny?”</p>

    <p>“Zat is what I say,” nodded Bardek firmly. “You
        know nothings. What! You do not know about Saint
        Acetum, ze Vinegar Saint; you do not know—” Bardek
        burst suddenly into ironic laughter—“because it
        is I, Bardek, who have jus’ made him up out of my
        head!”</p>

    <p>“Oh!” laughed Gorgas, somehow relieved at the
        thought that the Vinegar Saint was merely an invention
        of Bardek. “Allen Blynn, the Vinegar Saint!
        That is <i>too</i> funny!”</p>

    <p>“So you see,” Bardek was exulting in his cleverness,
        “<i>how</i> she must beat her little drum, that Lady, to draw
        down Saint Acetum, who is always repairing ze roof of
        ze Heaven?”</p>

    <p>Gorgas was sobered instantly. “Do you think that
        woman is trying to marry Mr. Blynn?” she asked anxiously.</p>

    <p>“No,” Bardek replied, while he watched her out of
        half-closed eyes; “I do not say so much. I think she
        do not know what she do. But she is <i>vairy</i> interested—oh,
        <i>vairy</i> interested—in the nice young man.
        She do not like him? Oh, no! But she go, and go;
        and she talk and she write. In all the great big world
        there is but one reason for that. The little roots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
        the weeds, zey shove and push and work and zey do not
        know why, but one day zey come out where is water;
        and <i>zen</i> zey know why.”
    </p>

    <p>“It is terrible!” the words escaped Gorgas involuntarily.
        It gave her an inexpressible sensation of
        illness to think of <i>mon capitaine</i> at the mercy of so
        irresistible a force.</p>

    <p>“Oh, no!” laughed Bardek; “it is not terrible.
        No! It is vairy wonderful and <i>le bon Dieu</i>, he has
        made it so!”</p>

    <p><i>Le bon Dieu!</i> Ah, no! It could not be from heaven,
        or why should the very thought of it torment her?</p>

    <p>She went home to nights of acute distress and days
        of smiling mockery. She listened to all sorts of inquiries
        about her health, parried the questions with
        vague fibbings; but she knew the cause of the storm
        that raged within.</p>

    <p>Then came a night of resignation. She surprised
        herself—and blamed herself, too—at her easy recovery.
        What powers of adaptability we have! The
        deepest grief is, somehow, assuaged. If it was to be;
        it was to be. She found herself, one day, laughing at
        herself. A fortnight later, she was lost in the preparation
        for her graduation from The Misses Warren’s
        Select French and English School for Young Ladies.
        The sorrows of seventeen are not fatal. Yes; she was
        quite herself now, marvelling only occasionally at the
        turbulence that had shaken her.</p>

    <p>And therein she deceived herself, as all of us continually
        do. She was quite her serene self—so she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
        thought. We know so little about ourselves, about
        what we think, about what we want, even about what
        we are doing. We talk much—confidently; we declaim,
        make speeches, deny vehemently, or affirm with
        hand upraised: but deep within us, like a Hidden River,
        flows the unconscious life. When it wells to the surface
        we know it for the first time, cry out in fear, or
        exult. When it subsides we say, “It is not there!”
        We are poor witnesses, with all our boastings and
        modesties, poor witnesses either for or against ourselves.</p>

    <p>“I wonder where my roots are going?” Gorgas
        asked herself. For answer she dropped the consideration
        of the width of ribbon she would wear on her
        graduation dress and sat down to write a letter to
        Allen Blynn. It was a burst of personal confession—the
        Hidden River was welling very, very near the
        surface!—and most particularly she told him about
        the “Brass Image,” and warned him. Then she read
        it over and destroyed it.</p>

    <p>“Oh, I guess I’m not brassy enough,” she said and
        shook her head.</p>

            RATS!</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THE Levering spring-house had long ago gone
        to pieces to furnish part of the masonry of a
        new workshop, designed by Bardek and built
        by Mac, with everybody assisting. They picked a spot
        at the north of the orchard, where the light was right,
        and distant enough from habitation to allow for the
        most riotous hammering. A great chimney with both
        hand- and foot-bellows forge was the center about
        which the one-story, roomy structure spread.</p>

    <p>The Leverings hardly knew what was going on.
        They had this satisfaction, however: Gorgas was on
        her own grounds, Mac was always within hail and
        Bardek, his wife, and the two shining-eyed youngsters
        had so won the affection of everyone that they were
        added as theoretic protectors. When young men called,
        they sauntered around to the cozy shop, looked on,
        smoked at their ease and drank continuous tea and ate
        toasted muffins. Kate often spent mornings there, pottering
        over punched brass, and thinking, to the pantomimic
        disgust of Bardek, that she was a workman,
        too. But no one seemed quite aware that a serious
        art was being studied in that busy quarter.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering began to get inklings of the deep nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
        of the undertaking when a big order for a complete
        hand-wrought silver service was finished, dispatched,
        and the check forwarded. Bardek had been
        the business manager in securing that and other orders
        which followed, and he had overseen the designing and
        had plotted out the work; but the labor and the return
        were placed entirely to Gorgas’ account.</p>

    <p>“My dear child,” the mother’s eyes focused agreeably
        upon the amount. “This is dreadful! You’re
        actually making money! Are you sure you are not
        taking advantage of someone? How could a little girl
        like you earn so much?”</p>

    <p>But she soon accustomed herself to that sort of
        thing, and promptly let Gorgas take out a separate
        bank account, and thriftily watched the amount swell.
        It was quite proper, she assured herself, for a girl to
        make money, provided she stayed at home, and provided,
        too, it was something respectable, like—uh—art.
        Of course, this metal business was art; at least,
        the silver part was—she was somewhat dubious over
        the copper, really, the most artistic accomplishment of
        the shop; and the settings of copper and semi-precious
        stones, the hand-wrought gold rings—that was art
        and respectable. She wished, of course, that there were
        no necessity for the ugly forge and for the heavy malleting;
        but then, that was all done in the secluded shop
        away from the street. To think that all this silly pottering
        had turned out to be worth something! What
        a wonderful adviser was Allen Blynn! When she
        thought of the pleasant checks, she was grateful that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
        she had been too busy at the time to oppose the building
        of the shop.</p>

    <p>But in spite of the obvious fact that Gorgas was able
        to earn her own way, the mother continued to keep a
        controlling hand, as if the child were still a toddler
        needing protection, and not an independent young
        woman of seventeen: her letters had still to be
        O. K.’d, the hours of retiring were not to be changed,
        and the other claims of womanhood, the style of gown
        and hat and the mode of wearing the hair—these were
        still matters of maternal jurisdiction. And being the
        younger daughter she had more mothering—as is often
        the case—than Kate, who had long ago secured her
        rights to do as she pleased.</p>

    <p>There were suggestions of rebellion and occasional
        flurries of attack and retreat. At seventeen, Gorgas
        had gained her right to give all her mornings to the
        “smitty,” as the shop was locally dubbed; she had won
        out in her right to play tennis and hockey, to bicycle
        and—an ability discovered by Bardek—to fence.</p>

    <p>“Why can’t you just ride or drive and take walks?”
        the mother had complained. “These other games are
        so boyish and ‘tough,’ my dear. They give you a
        color like a hoyden—positively I was ashamed of you
        last Wednesday at dinner—and you have a stride like
        a young rowdy. Of course, I can’t tell you it’s not
        ladylike. I see that has no effect upon you; but you
        might consider how I feel when you walk through the
        streets in that tennis costume—I suppose one might
        call it a costume. In a boy it is all right; young Morris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
        is quite attractive; but you, you look positively unsexed,
        Gorgas—I’m almost ashamed to use the word. And
        really, my dear, I must object to your putting off stays.
        You will never come around if you don’t begin early.
        Your figure is—well, is there no proper womanly argument
        that can reach you?”</p>

    <p>“Health, first, mother,” Gorgas would say firmly.
        “I work hard all morning, I practice at music, to
        please you, and I must keep up my reading. Then,
        open air for me and a stiff fight and a shower. That
        makes me sing; makes me fit to do things. I wouldn’t
        have an original design in my head if I cooped up like
        most women. They are talking about voting! I’m
        with them there, but good Heavens! they could be enfranchised
        tomorrow if they could only break loose and
        live a decent, wholesome life.”</p>

    <p>The severest quarrel was over clothes. Gorgas’ artistic
        sense was a deep-rooted thing. She protested,
        but without result, against the slave-like selection of
        “what everybody was wearing.” Women seemed to be
        uniformed like a squad of infantry, irrespective of individual
        build or personal taste. That repelled her.
        Not that she wanted to do anything eccentric; it was
        just her desire to be inconspicuous that led to a wish
        to study herself and, within the restrictions of the prevailing
        vogue, to clothe herself true to her own personal
        note.</p>

    <p>Blynn had walked with her on one of his rare holidays
        home—lecturing usually kept him busy in vacation
        time—when she was driven out of herself and into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
        stolidity by the mere fact of an outrageous puffed-sleeve
        affair, over which her mother had spent hours of
        selecting. To Gorgas, it was like wearing some other
        person’s clothing. She had gawked about, submerged
        in self-consciousness; and her chagrin she expressed in
        vindictive attacks on the unoffending Allen.</p>

    <p>Gorgas resolved to end it then and there. One afternoon
        in February, 1893—Gorgas was seventeen and
        a half, but felt tremendously older—she interviewed
        the chief cutter of a smart Walnut street tailoring establishment
        and outlined to him her plans for a series
        of frocks and coats that made his eyes glisten. She
        produced a check for part-payment, and made it peremptorily
        clear that her own ideas were to prevail or
        no sale.</p>

    <p>“Mother, I’ve ordered some spring clothes,” she let
        the news out bluntly. “I won’t stand being dressed
        and undressed and being put to bed any longer. You’d
        better get used to the idea, for it’s to be the thing. I’m
        paying my way now and I’ve got to go it on my own.”</p>

    <p>And then she left immediately for the “smitty.”</p>

    <p>Those were stormy days in the Levering family, but
        the disturbance was all from the elders. Gorgas was
        serene and calm. They were sure Gorgas would adopt
        some reckless fashion that would put them down before
        everybody, probably a bifurcated skirt or an out-and-out
        Dr. Mary Walker attire. There was much talk
        in the air at that period of boldly abolishing the dress
        distinction of sex. But when Gorgas appeared before
        them one afternoon in a neat, inconspicuous, tailor-made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
        gown, right as to style, but with a mysterious
        wonder in it of something just beyond the style, the
        family capitulated. Capitulated? They broke ranks
        and rushed over one another to cheer the enemy.</p>

    <p>Mount Airy, after all, had always been a country
        village. Its main charm, in spite of its nearness to a
        large city, was not its suburbanity, but its rurality.
        And it was well-known that the most careful copying
        by Mount Airyites of the designs in Godey’s “Lady
        Book,” would always be crude and home-made when
        compared with exactly the same pattern worn by the
        city ladies who could be seen any day moving in and
        out of certain exclusive in-town shops. The distinguishing
        difference is not so much one of material as
        of art.</p>

    <p>In that apparel Gorgas could have argued the family
        out of its house and grounds. Oh, the subtle overpowering
        authority of the right gown! It will give
        strength to weakness, add courage to the natural
        craven, and overawe even Lizzie-in-the-kitchen. If I
        were a physician I would make most of my prescriptions
        on the blanks of proper tailors. Most women are not
        ill, they are simply inadequately gowned; their strength
        is oozing away through the terrible struggle to feel
        better than they look. And it is not primarily a question
        of money; it is a matter of taste and intelligence.</p>

    <p>The young men responded instantly to the new touch.
        They didn’t know how it had happened, but the news
        passed quickly along that Gorgas Levering was “all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
        right.” Callers, formal and informal, of all ages from
        sixteen to thirty-five, dropped in or begged permission,
        according to the type. The “smitty,” on Thursday
        afternoons, became a sort of rendezvous for all this
        fluttering group. Work and play were declared off,
        and the reception of guests was in order. Mrs. Levering
        occasionally dropped in, in her capacity as overseer,
        but Kate was always present, the mother’s viceroy;
        and Bea Wilcox and a few of Gorgas’ intimates; and,
        of course, Bardek.</p>

    <p>Here they sang, chatted and danced as the mood
        seized. And on clear, summer afternoons there was
        always the tennis-court and the shadowy orchard; in
        winter there was hockey and skating on the Wissahickon
        at Valley Green, or, more often, roastings and toastings
        before the huge log fire in the “smitty.”</p>

    <p>Gorgas’ permanent exhibition of unsold work brought
        other visitors. These came at all times. Usually, it
        was Bardek’s business to do the explaining and the
        selling, a duty he loved, and some of the customers became
        regular visitors and eventually slipped over into
        the Thursday afternoon group. Not that the Thursday
        afternoon group could be kept away at other times.
        Gorgas rather welcomed the opportunity to chat while
        she worked, but she always worked—except once.</p>

    <p>One Thursday in April Morris took Gorgas aside and
        asked if he couldn’t come the next day in the morning
        and have a private talk with her.</p>

    <p>She looked him over suspiciously.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“We’ve been partners for a long while, Neddie,” she
        summed up her look. “This sounds mighty strange
        and mysterious. Give me a hint beforehand. What’s
        up?”</p>

    <p>“Can’t do it here,” he scowled at the crowd. “I’ll
        be in at about eleven. What d’y’ say?”</p>

    <p>“How absurd you are,” she held him off to search
        his face. “You know anyone may see me at any time.”</p>

    <p>“I know,” he hastened to explain awkwardly in the
        midst of the chatter and movement. “This is different.
        This is something—I can’t tell you here.”</p>

    <p>“Well,” she patted him on the arm, “come along,
        sonny. You’ll have to talk loud. I’ve got a special
        fine lot of hammering to do that won’t wait.”</p>

    <p>That night she tossed about and brought herself to
        book.</p>

    <p>Morris had been behaving lately in a way they do
        before they begin to go to pieces and become temporary
        asses in the presence of their Titania. He had lost his
        fine spirit of <i>camaraderie</i>. He had been glaring at his
        fraternity pin, which Gorgas used, like a dozen other
        such articles, to adorn the dress it best suited. He had
        been moody and listless—the usual symptoms; and he
        had been hanging about like a stupid.</p>

    <p>Try as she might she couldn’t get a thrill out of the
        thought. Ned Morris was a brother; that was all; a
        splendid chum, the sort at fellow you get terribly used
        to and wouldn’t give up without a fight. But anything
        else— Horrors! It was profanation of friendship to
        think it.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Nevertheless, she enjoyed the prospect of an adorer.
        It gave her the most unaccountable feeling of elation
        and self-pity and yearning and depression—all enjoyable
        sensations, every one. It attacked her so hard
        that she arose at sun-up, ate no breakfast, and let the
        metal work slide.</p>

    <p>“You do not work today?” Bardek looked up from
        his bench, where he was inlaying a hair-like design of
        silver in the softest copper.</p>

    <p>“Nope.”</p>

    <p>“You are sick, may be?”</p>

    <p>“Goodness, no!”</p>

    <p>Hammer, hammer, hammer.</p>

    <p>“Goin’ to jus’—loaf, eh?”</p>

    <p>“Rather.”</p>

    <p>Hammer, hammer.</p>

    <p>“Ah! you fight the French revolution all over again
        with the mother?” he guessed. “<i>Bome! bome!</i> Down
        will go t’e Bastile. Huzza! Out come the prisoners—little
        ladies who t’eir mutters have boxed up! <i>Vive
            la révolution des jeunes filles!</i>”</p>

    <p>Hammer, hammer, hammer.</p>

    <p>“What?” he looked up.</p>

    <p>“Wrong tack, Bardek. Take in a reef.”</p>

    <p>“Eh? What?”</p>

    <p>“And let down your jib.”</p>

    <p>“<i>Nom du nom!</i> What language you talk?” Tap,
        tap, tap. “Somebody come, eh?”</p>

    <p>“Yes; Morris.”</p>

    <p>“Ho-ho-o-o!” softly, as much as to say, “So that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
        the way the wind blows.” “Ho-ho-o-o!” louder, meaning,
        “I’ve been suspecting that boy.” “Ho-ho-o-o!”
        very wisely, with a glance that said, “I understand
        what’s in your little head, missy!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, rats! Bardek.”</p>

    <p>She arose and tried a few strokes, but soon gave it up.</p>

    <p>“Perhaps Morris he would take share in partnership?”
        Bardek inquired with grotesque sympathy.</p>

    <p>“Rats!” she called back.</p>

    <p>“R-rats!” Bardek laughed as he tapped. “Rats—it
        is the meaning of what? When I say, ‘How
        beautiful is Miss Gorgas, this morning,’ Miss Gorgas
        say, ‘Rats!’—that is to say, ‘Thank you so much
        for compliment.’ When I say, ‘She work too hard, she
        must play more,’ Miss Gorgas say, ‘Rats!’—that is
        to say, ‘Do you think I small child, eh?’ If I say,
        ‘When you going marry, Miss Gorgas?’ Miss Gorgas
        say, ‘Rats!’—which is to say, ‘Shut up, you ol’ fool,
        and mind own business.’ It is vairy convenient; one
        nice, little word do for everything. It mean, ‘I don’t
        believe you’; it mean, ‘Go bag your head’; it mean,
        ‘Not on your tin-type.’ Jus’ now it mean, ‘Mr. Morris
        will talk to Miss Gorgas on vairy important matter.
        Ol’ Bardek better take holiday and fix more w’ite-wash
        in his house.’”</p>

    <p>“Rats! Bardek,” she stopped him. “Stay where
        you are. I don’t want to seem to be clearing everybody
        out for Ned Morris. If we want to talk privately,
        we’ll go into the orchard. It’s warm enough outside.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Bardek grinned so openly that she was forced into
        some sort of explanation. She talked earnestly and
        Bardek affected to be perfectly guileless.</p>

    <p>“Morris is just a good friend, Bardek; not a thing
        more. Not a thing more.”</p>

    <p>“Rats!” roared Bardek, suddenly slipping from
        earnest solicitude into loud irony. “Oh, I love that
        nice, easy, little word. It saves so much breath. I
        say, ‘Rats!’ and I mean, oh, a whole lot. With one
        word I say, ‘Don’t you be telling me all that foolishness
        about friend business and all that. The friend
        business is all played out. It had one grand failure,
        long ago, when Adam thought he try. Mr. Morris, he
        just like Adam. He hang ’round ’while and watch animals
        and sleep in the sun. Then, one day he wake up
        and he say he want nice, long talk, all alone; and Eve,
        she dress up in nice clothes, she can’t work, can’t hammer,
        can’t sit down, can’t walk, can’t do one thing
        but look and look and look at not’ing at all, and say,
        ‘Rats!’ All that for one little word!”</p>

    <p>“Double fault, Bardek; you’re putting too many in
        the net.”</p>

    <p>That was one way thoroughly to mystify the earnest
        student of English. Bardek studied hard, but never
        succeeded in getting the hang of American sporting
        terms. “Get a good lead! Go down with his arm!
        Two out; play for the batter! 68-22, through left-guard!”
        These phrases seemed to have meaning to
        Americans, but not one spark of intelligence was in
        them for the many-languaged Bohemian.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“I put too many into the net?” he repeated. “T’e
        English cannot be one of my native speeches, but when
        I see all these nice—” he drawled it into something like
        “nah-ees”—“young boys flying so like butterfly
        ’round Miss Gorgas I zink she do not put <i>one</i> into the
        net!”</p>

    <p>Gorgas was busy sorting out some long branches of
        fresh willow for a corner decoration. She looked over
        sideways at Bardek, who tapped away with the air of
        a man who has made a hit. But she silenced him.</p>

    <p>“Play in, boys; he’s going to bunt,” she remarked
        and watched with satisfaction the grin fade from Bardek’s
        face and in its place appear the rapt expression of
        a puzzled linguist.</p>

    <p>“What is this—‘bunt’?” he asked at last, his mind
        completely off guard.</p>

    <p>“It is an unexpected bingle, Bardek, that puts the
        infield in the soup,” she explained serenely as she left
        the “smitty” for more willow branches.</p>

        <h3 class="nobreak">XVII<br>

            AN UNEXPECTED BINGLE</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">FOR awhile Bardek tapped away and struggled
        with the slang of the ’90’s. “‘Bingle,’” he
        murmured and shook his head. “‘Bunt,’
        ‘Soup,’ I have lost the art of taking in languages. I
        grow old. My cerebellum turns to that same ‘soup.’”</p>

    <p>Bardek sighed, a genuine old-fashioned sigh, full of
        undefined longing. Uncomfortable feelings swept over
        him, whose source he knew not.</p>

    <p>“<i>Nom de la manne céleste!</i>” he ejaculated, putting
        down his hammer. Wide-eyed, he gazed out of the
        window toward the fast budding maples. It was a
        French day, <i>sans doute</i>. “Spring!” he exulted aloud
        in the appropriate language. “How it is ever beautiful,
        the spring. In France, best of all, but even here
        in Mount Airy it is good, the spring. In my old trunk
        the sap goes up, up, and spins my thoughts about. I
        am full of ideas in the spring, little shoots of thinking
        and buds and leaves of grand notions. How I can do
        things in the spring!” But he stood listlessly gazing.
        “Do? Bah! I can do nothing but dream of what I
        can never do; ... but it is good.”</p>

    <p>Slowly his mind drifted to Gorgas and then back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
        the starting point of their conversation. His face
        lighted up, beamed with sympathy.</p>

    <p>“So, that is what it is!” he chuckled. “He is a
        good fellow, Neddie. Nice, clean American fellow.
        But he is only boy wit’ face like girl. How young is
        all America! When I was twenty I was man. I had
        been in army. I had learned my work in life. I had
        seen the world. Now I am forty and old man. All the
        little American children of thirty, forty, fifty,—Professor
        Blynn, Miss Kate, Mrs. Levering, they all come
        to ask me what to do; me, Bardek! I have the wisdom
        of old gentleman about to sit down and die. Phoo-ee!”
        He puffed out a big breath and looked joyfully out of
        the window. “And I am ten t’ousand years younger
        than all of them put together.”</p>

    <p>The flooding thoughts of spring were too much for
        Bardek. He doffed his apron, put his tools carefully in
        their racks and made ready to get out into the open.
        He hummed like a prowling bumble-bee as he tossed
        things about.</p>

    <p>“Hello, Bardek. Where’s Gorgas?” Morris spoke
        from the doorway.</p>

    <p>“Ah!” Bardek turned jubilantly, came forward in
        great strides and shook the young man warmly by both
        hands. “She is here! She is here!” he exulted, looking
        the astonished Morris over joyfully. “Jus’ you
        sit yourself. The big easy chair? No!” He dragged
        forward a cushioned settle. “<i>V’là!</i> It is the best for
        little <i>tête-à-tête</i>. Oh, you lucky young man! To have
        Miss Gorgas to talk to all alone. See! I will jus’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
        pull down this window thing, as— Where is she, that
        Eve who cannot work this morning—” He looked
        anxiously out of the door toward the orchard.</p>

    <p>“Can’t work?” Morris inquired. “What’s the
        trouble, Bardek? Ill?”</p>

    <p>“Ill?” Bardek exploded. “Oh, yes. She is—ho!—yes,
        it is a disease, vairy, vairy dangerous. It is
        good to get it early, like the chicken-poxes and measles.
        Hey!” looking at him curiously. “You, Neddie;
        don’t you ever feel like kicking out all the little
        life-businesses and rushing out into woods away from
        every one, to weep and laugh and sleep and swear
        and pray? Look inside. Close your eyes and look
        inside. Have you not got terrible voice in t’ere what
        say: <i>Prenez la clef des champs! Faites l’école buissonnière!</i>
        Take the key of the fields and play truant
        in the woods!... Day like dese! How can men stay
        in chicken-houses!”</p>

    <p>He slipped out of a workman’s blouse and ruffled his
        hair excitedly.</p>

    <p>“That’s spring fever, Bardek,” Morris explained.
        “Guess I’ve got a touch of it, too.” He yawned and
        began to make a cigarette. Then he turned the logs
        over in the grate.</p>

    <p>“Miss Gorgas,” Bardek motioned eloquently toward
        the orchard, “is jus’ out in the trees, watching young
        leaves come.”</p>

    <p>Bardek struck an expectant attitude.</p>

    <p>Morris drew the settle up to the fire and picked up
        a book.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“The spring fever have made you dumb, perhaps?
        I say she is jus’ out! Two, t’ree steps,” he looked out
        of the window, “at the big cherry she is now ...
        eh?”</p>

    <p>“Thanks, Bardek,” Morris yawned and stretched his
        legs. “I’ll just smoke and read a little.... She’ll
        be back presently, I suppose.”</p>

    <p>The Bohemian stared. Then he seized a huge hammer
        and smote mightily, like Tubalcain himself.</p>

    <p>“Holy mackerel, Bardek!” Morris turned, laughing.
        “This is only a stone hut, you know.... What y’
        making, a battleship?”</p>

    <p>“You have not put many in t’e net lately, eh?” Bardek
        stopped to inquire irrelevantly. He was experimenting
        with the new phrases.</p>

    <p>“Oh, my full share, I fancy. What makes you
        ask?”</p>

    <p>Bardek was bitterly indignant, but the emotion was
        lost on Morris’ back.</p>

    <p>“I though’ you came here dis morning to, ah, bunt.
        What?”</p>

    <p>“Bunt?”</p>

    <p>“Yess.... Bingle.”</p>

    <p>“Bingle?”</p>

    <p>“Yess, bingle.”</p>

    <p>“It’s lost on me, old man. I came here to talk to
        Gorgas.”</p>

    <p>He resumed his reading, smoked at leisure and turned
        over pages carelessly. Bardek smote one vicious blow
        and exclaimed:</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Then you don’t want to—ah—get in the soup
        wit’ Miss Gorgas, eh?”</p>

    <p>“What?”</p>

    <p>Morris swung completely around.</p>

    <p>“You have spring fever? <i>You?</i> Yah!” Bardek
        ejaculated his disgust in unspellable exclamations.
        “<i>Ah, non! non! non! non! non!</i> You are lazy? Yess.
        You like comfortable seat at small fire? Yess. But
        you still froze up like dead tree. The sap, it not yet
        run up. I tell you, ‘Miss Gorgas is in orchard.’ You
        say, ‘Oh, vairy well,’ and fix nice cushions to sit. I
        say, ‘She is one, two, t’ree step away.’ You roll cigarette
        and read book. <i>Nom d’une pipe!</i> How you sit
        and smoke when live woman wait for you, eh? One,
        two, t’ree step at the big cherry, eh? Name of a pipe!
        Your blood, it is water! Me, I go out!” He seized
        his hat. “I, I am yet young, alive, and sprout green
        things. I ’fraid I stay and catch your fever. Spring
        fever? <i>Peste! Nom du nom!</i> It is a disease of the
        winter, you have, my friend.”</p>

    <p>In a trice Bardek was plunging down the lane, which
        led to Montgomery county. “<i>Ah! que je suis un petit
            oiseau</i>,” he was singing gloriously.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>Gorgas sat in the sun on a bench under the bursting
        cherry tree, her hands clasping her knees and her eyes
        wide awake and staring. Somehow, that morning, her
        mind would not advance to conclusions; it remained
        dead-locked between the thought of Morris and all that
        he would probably say, and the answer that she knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
        she must make. But she would not let herself decide;
        she liked to play with the idea, to toss it about among
        the possibilities, view it from strange angles. Marriage
        was probably just this sort of thing—a little talk with
        a man, an agreement, dresses, the march up the aisle,
        and years together. Anything else was just romance,
        the stuff one makes fiction out of. Fiction! How well
        named!</p>

    <p>But it was not the way she dreamed the event would
        happen. Her notion of felicity was much more strenuous
        and fearsome. At any time she wanted she could
        walk into the “smitty,” say “Hello, Neddie,” and end
        the whole business. There was nothing daring about
        that. But shouldn’t there be something to be afraid
        of?</p>

    <p>Her man should surprise her—she thought out her
        best theory; she had several, depending on the mood!—come
        upon her at, say, twilight. She would like to
        see his staring, laughing face peer suddenly over her
        shoulder, and in a moment find herself in his mad grip.
        She should become weak with positive fright, and be a
        little afraid of him all her life. “I should probably
        scratch and bite,” she thought, “but he must laugh,
        and perhaps pinch my ear, till I yelped and let go.”</p>

    <p>There was nothing frightening about Neddie Morris.
        Well; one had better go in and have it over. She
        would offer him tea.... If he drank it she would hate
        him. Pshaw! Life is just tea drinking, after all. It
        spoils one to dream of the impossible.... Oh, this
        spring weather! Ha-ho-hum!... Let him wait....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
        This thing has to be thought out. Let’s see; where
        were we?... But her mind hung motionless.</p>

    <p>From her bench she could see Morris lighting a cigarette;
        but she remained and basked in her own dreams.
        Some things are better the longer they are postponed.
        Those cherry buds were just straining to get out.
        Look at that wise, silly robin tugging away at a tuft
        of string tangled on a stick! Everything was unfolding
        and getting ready for new life—even Gorgas.</p>

    <p>Thundering mallet blows came from the “smitty.”
        It did not sound like Bardek. Certainly if he threw
        that sort of reckless force upon the frail lace-like silver
        upon which he should be working, there would be something
        annihilated. Perhaps Morris was growing impatient.
        Well—she hugged her knees—he would
        have to wait. She couldn’t go in to him until she had
        made up her mind about him.</p>

    <p>Why should one ever decide? The joy of living is
        expecting. Who ever wants anything he gets? Possession
        is the beginning of dissatisfaction. Even if exactly
        the right man ... exactly the right man! ...
        should be waiting in the “smitty” it would be better
        to let him wait. The right man! Her eyes closed as
        she pictured that man, sitting expectant in the
        “smitty,” never dreaming she was so near; oh, the
        shivering ecstasy of holding him there forever with all
        his story yet to tell. Into her memory came lines from
        “The Grecian Urn,” which she and Allen Blynn had
        learned together; with eyes still closed she spoke them
        reverently aloud:</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span></p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“Hello, Gorgas,” Morris blundered upon her.
        “What are you mumbling? Poetry? Sounded like
        something with jiggles in it. Are you warm enough
        out here? I’ve got the shivers. C-come on b-back in
        the ‘smitty.’ We can t-talk better there. C-come
        on.”</p>

    <p>“Wait. Please!” she begged. “Let’s don’t go
        back just yet. The—uh—everything’s so wonderful
        and springy out here. Don’t let’s talk just yet.
        Just listen to the sparrows.”</p>

    <p>“Ug-g-g!” he shivered. “W-w-onderful l-l-ittl-le
        p-p-pests. How do you s-s-tand it? Without your
        c-coat, too. I’m g-going in.”</p>

    <p>He danced a clog and flapped his arms, while he
        sang:</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“<i>Don’t do that!</i>” she snapped suddenly. He
        stopped. “You look ridiculous.” Then penitently,
        “I was thinking lovely thoughts, and you jarred the
        picture.... Let’s go in.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>The settle, arranged beautifully before the fire, made
        her thoughtful. He started for it and beckoned her to
        follow, but she let him take the huge seat alone.</p>

    <p>“That fire is too warm for me this morning,” she
        excused herself for sitting on a near-by hassock, where
        she could hug her knees and look up at him. In that
        position, while he talked and smoked innumerable cigarettes,
        she watched him dreamily.</p>

    <p>There were few finer fellows than Ned Morris, she
        told herself. He was not only good to look at but he
        was a good “pard” and an unequaled sportsman. He
        had a reputation, too, a name—of course, that was
        not a thing to consider, yet a woman likes her man to
        be known for right qualities. It would be a comfort
        to have folks say, “Oh, Ned Morris, the tennis Morris?”
        Rather vain, that; but there are a hundred
        kinds of vanity, and some are virtues.</p>

    <p>“What I wanted to see you about, Gorgas,” he began
        finally, looking suddenly at the grandfather clock
        in the corner—</p>

    <p>“Not just yet, Ned,” Gorgas protested quietly.
        “Tell me about the Boys’ Club dinner first. I understand
        it went off like a Bellevue spread.”</p>

    <p>Goodness! It was almost out, and then it would be
        all over, a pretty little dream spoiled by waking. Why
        are men so straightforward and possessing? Of course,
        she liked them best when they came selfishly demanding
        things. Meek ones—well, they might inherit the
        earth, but they could not share her goods and chattels....
        Perhaps they would have to give up being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
        friends.... No ... that would never do.... She
        began to see ... decision was slowly coming ...
        rather than break with him altogether she would just
        take him over, have one everlasting final row with the
        mater and decamp for—</p>

    <p>“But I must get down to business, Gorgas,” he suddenly
        changed the topic. “What I’m going to say to
        you is darned hard to get out, so I’m just going to
        plump it at you like—”</p>

    <p>She leaned forward and laid two nervous hands upon
        his nearest arm.</p>

    <p>“Couldn’t you—couldn’t you just not say anything,
        Ned?... Couldn’t you wait until—tomorrow
        or next month?”</p>

    <p>He stopped a smoke-ring in the act of being launched
        and looked at her searchingly. She was staring up at
        him with distress in her brown eyes.</p>

    <p>“Why, what’s the matter, old girl?” he inquired
        solicitously. “I don’t believe you’re feeling fit, today.
        If you say so, I’ll cut out.” He arose, but she still sat
        watching him. “Awfully sorry if I’ve blundered
        around here when—I might have noticed you were not
        working today. Of course, I wanted to talk this thing
        out with you. It’s got to be done—and mighty soon,
        I can tell you. But, if you think the other way, why,
        I’ll just drop it for awhile.... But gee! I did so
        hope I could get this thing settled....”</p>

    <p>“I think I know what you are going to say, Ned,”
        she arose, too. “And I’m going to let you say it. I
        couldn’t make up my mind until this minute. You are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
        right; it must be settled now. It wouldn’t be fair to
        you to wait another day.... Go on.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t see how you knew,” he wondered, “unless
        Bea told you.”</p>

    <p>“Bea? Bea Wilcox?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” he went on hurriedly. “It’s the fraternity
        pin. I’ve got to let the cat out of the bag, I suppose.
        It’s a dead secret yet. Bea and I have about agreed
        to—uh—make it up. Uh—you know what I mean.
        Been keeping it rather dark, of course. She hasn’t
        quite come over yet.... She doesn’t seem to understand
        about the ‘frat’ pin.... Thinks it means a lot
        of nonsense. I offered her another, but she won’t take
        it. Says a girl who wears a man’s ‘frat’ pin is as
        good as engaged to him, and all that sort of stuff.
        What I want to know is—oh, this is a rotten thing
        to have to say—what I thought was that you wouldn’t
        mind giving it back and sort o’ explain things to Bea.
        She got real nasty over it, flared up and—what’s the
        matter? By George! You <i>are</i> ill; aren’t you?
        Shan’t I send for somebody or something?”</p>

    <p>Gorgas was on the settle, her face buried in her
        hands, and laughing hysterically. Gasps and volleys
        of laughter followed in quick succession.</p>

    <p>“Oh, Neddie!” she cried, “you’ve played a cracker-jack
        joke on me. Oh! oh!” she breathed hard in the
        endeavor to recover. “You’ve given me—a—pain on
        the inside.... I thought—good heavens, will I ever
        get over this!” She sat up with an effort and dried her
        laughing eyes. “I thought all the time it was me you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
        wanted! You looked so silly ... and ... mooney
        ... and I was ready to give you the mitten.... I
        think I was. You got me so flabbergasted and sentimental,
        I don’t know what I’d have done. It made me
        so sorry for you I was almost ready to cry ... and
        now....” she went off again. “I’ll get a bad cold
        from this,” she sniffed at a ball of handkerchief. “Oh,
        boy, I haven’t been so upset and turned about for a
        dog’s age.... And how in the name of scandal have
        you kept this affair so dark? I see Bea every other
        day and she hasn’t blinked an eyelash. The she-fox!
        I’ll have her scalp for this.”</p>

    <p>Morris did not join in the merriment. He grinned
        occasionally, but it was a forced grimace. He was
        looking at Gorgas and making contrasts. Gorgas had
        always seemed just a good chum, but suddenly she
        seemed to have put on sex. To add to the humor, he
        tried clumsily to make excuses for not thinking of her
        in a more complimentary way. Bea <i>was</i> rather stormy
        and unreasonable. And Gorgas was growing more
        stunning every day. Doubts began to assail him.</p>

    <p>“Don’t look at me that way, Ned,” she expostulated,
        still shaken by flurries of merriment. “That’s what
        fooled me lately. That moonstruck gaze! Oh! You
        should save them for Bea. No! On second thought
        you had better shoot them all at me.... Bea <i>might</i>
        change her mind.... Now! I feel better.”</p>

    <p>She was touching her eyes quietly, and Morris was
        standing above her looking down thoughtfully, when
        Bardek poked a cautious head in the door. Seeing all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
        quiet, he attempted to steal across the room to the
        corner where he kept a bludgeon of a stick, which he
        loved to carry with him on his walks.</p>

    <p>Gorgas caught him in the act of skipping through
        the door.</p>

    <p>“Come back here, you truant,” she called.</p>

    <p>He looked in, smiling knowingly.</p>

    <p>“All settled up?” he inquired mildly.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” Gorgas smiled back. “Everything O. K.”</p>

    <p>“O. K.,” he hummed. “So he bunt? Eh?”</p>

    <p>Nobody answered.</p>

    <p>“When you take you’ w’ite-wash house, eh?”</p>

    <p>“But he didn’t bunt, Bardek,” she laughed mischievously.</p>

    <p>“Not bunt? Then why everyt’ing—O. K.?” he
        demanded.</p>

    <p>“No, Bardek,” she explained. “You see, it was this
        way. I played in for a bunt—”</p>

    <p>“You played in for a bunt? You! I see that—”</p>

    <p>“But instead of bunting, he biffed one on the nose—”</p>

    <p>“Biffed? On the nose? <i>Qu’est-ce que c’est que
            ça?</i>”</p>

    <p>“Yes, on the nose for a homer.”</p>

    <p>Bardek’s face was blank.</p>

    <p>“In other words, Bardek—”</p>

    <p>“I <i>hope</i> you have the other words,” he said helplessly.</p>

    <p>“We can’t agree on that white-wash business, Neddie
        and I. So, it’s all off. Game postponed on account
        of previous engagement.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“Phoo-ee! but how glad I am! Pos’pone!” Bardek
        stamped his stick on the floor. “How glad I am!
        First I thought I was happy, and then I found out when
        I walk through the woods that it was not happiness.
        I say, ‘It is not happiness, then what is it? Something
        like happiness; it make me laugh and jump and
        cry and feel hot and cold and glad and sick.’ Then
        I find out. It comes to me. It is not happiness I feel.
        It is misery. You—nice, clean you—to go off and
        give up to small boy like little Neddie here who don’t
        know nothing. I come back; I think, maybe if I see him
        first I can make him understand that he mus’ wait till
        he grow up and have mind. He smoke cigarette, vairy
        good. He sit down, nah-eese; he read book, oh, not
        bad—but he not real man wit’ arteries and muscles
        and hot forge-fires down inside. He jus’ littl’ puppy
        that play wit’ tail.... But I come back and all is
        lovely.... Now!” he seized his smudgy blouse, “I
        can work!”</p>

    <p>He snatched his hammer and bent to his delicate task.
        Meanwhile, Gorgas was entering into the plot to satisfy
        the tyrannic Bea.</p>

    <p>But Morris took a new tack. He wasn’t sure now
        that he wanted the old pin back. Girls shouldn’t be so
        domineering. They needed lessons, sometimes.</p>

    <p>“You’ve upset me, Gorgas,” confessed Morris.
        “I’m just finding out what a lot I think of you....
        Bea and I—well, we’re not so sure, either of us. I—perhaps—”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Say!” called Bardek. “What you mean by zat
        ‘home-run’; eh?”</p>

    <p>“Just you watch Ned Morris,” she replied, looking
        at Ned with the compelling face of a determined mother.
        “If he doesn’t make one without so much as another
        word I’ll call strikes on him.... One! Two—”</p>

    <p>“I’m off,” laughed Ned, but he swung his hand and
        wafted a suspicious-looking salute at her.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>“Now for work,” said Gorgas firmly, donning her
        apron.</p>

    <p>But instead, she looked out of the window at the
        robins frantically building their nests. One set was
        at work just above in the eaves. Most interesting
        chaps; so energetic and serious. The silence in the
        shop caught her attention. She turned around. Bardek,
        too, was leaning over his bench and staring at the
        greening world outside.</p>

    <p>He turned swiftly and met her gaze. One deprecatory
        glance he tossed toward the idle work-bench and
        then a meaningful sweep toward all of outdoors. They
        both stood silent, stirred by the invitation of the morning;
        and they laughed like guilty children about to slip
        away from school.</p>

    <p>Suddenly he spread out his hands and broke into
        vehement Italian.</p>

    <p>“The mother is calling all her little children,” he
        protested. “Wise old Demeter is leaning over the edge
        of the black pit of Hell-mouth, talking love talk to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
        daughter Proserpina, who comes forth with garlands
        and sprigs of little blossoming things and all the
        breezes of spring. Come, <i>Proserpina mia</i>! Let us do
        a bacchanal in the white sunlight, push through branch
        and briar, and loaf on the bare earth and sing the song
        of the hour!... Come!”</p>

    <p>“Come?” she echoed. “Let someone try to stop
        me. Wait! Just wait till I change this clumsy skirt.”
        Into a capacious closet she shut herself and in half a
        minute sprang forth. “<i>Comme ça!</i>” she fell into the
        familiar French. “We’re off! I feel so healthy and
        strong that I could run a dozen miles without taking
        a long breath.”</p>

    <p>“And I,” cried Bardek, back into French. “I?
        With one little jump—so!—I could hop over the
        stars! Come!”</p>

    <p>He tucked her arm in his and marched out, singing of
        <i>Le Roi D’ Yvetot</i>, that jolly old king who lived in
        a mud hut, went to bed early, and got up late, who
        didn’t care a fippence for fame or reputation; his crown
        was a cotton cap and his sole bodyguard a lazy hound.
    </p>

    <p>Through the orchard they trudged, both joining in
        the laughing chorus,</p>

            A PARABLE OF IGNORANCE</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THAT night Gorgas wrote a long letter to Allen
        Blynn. It was so unlike the usual stilted
        newsletters that it made him wonder. The
        transition between childlike scraps of information and
        a flowing, spirited communication, was absolutely
        abrupt, as if she had been holding herself back all this
        while—as in reality she had done—assuming a
        naïveté not natural. This letter was a splendid personal
        outpouring; it did not contain a single reference
        to the doings of social Mount Airyites.</p>

    <p>The theme was, Woman and her desire to be a free,
        untrammeled spirit, to express herself in work and play,
        to let develop whatever was within, not caring what
        happens. She wished she had the courage to give herself
        free rein, she told him, to be able not to care about
        the opinions of others, a crushing force, and so find out
        what were her possibilities. All personal development,
        all development of peoples, is a revolt and a demand
        for the right to grow. It is they who “give in” who
        eventually give up and become stamped with the mark
        of a caste. One must have room to expand, even if
        one smashes the receptacle which holds things together.
        In such broad generalization she summed up her view.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>Her own character, she knew, had been made by her
        little rebellions. Bardek had taught her the meaning
        of freedom; but she lacked his courage to be really herself.
        “You don’t know what you have in there,” he
        would often say, tapping his heart and his head.
        “Only God knows, who gave you great forces to use.”
        She was seventeen and thoroughly matured, she admitted,
        yet custom hardly sanctioned even her apparel.
        What she had achieved in that department was won by
        fighting; and it was a fact, she bore witness in every
        daily movement, that until she had boldly adopted the
        costume of womanhood she had not been able to think
        the thoughts of woman. So small a thing as inches on
        a skirt influenced mightily one’s very thinking. How
        strange was that; but how much more powerful were
        other restrictions. Until one accepted freedom and
        moved forward, there was a stoppage of mental growth.</p>

    <p>Many things she would like to do but dared not. At
        this moment, if she had the courage, she told him, she
        would slip into a travelling-gown, pack a bag, and take
        a sleeper for Holden. In the morning she would go
        straight to her <i>capitaine</i>, Allen Blynn, have breakfast
        with him and spend the day talking anything that chose
        to come into their heads, and read poetry, and let the
        world slip. The spring air had done this thing to her—she
        knew that; but why should one resist the call of
        spring. Cherry blossoms did not resist. Neither did
        the veriest worms. All night long Birchall’s dog had
        barked his delight. Why shouldn’t he? He didn’t consider,
        “Gorgas Levering is trying to sleep; I should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
        do this natural thing; I will resist the overpowering
        temptation to yowl.” If he did he would cease to be
        a dog. Next spring it would be easier for him to shut
        up; and in a few years he would move into a porch-house
        and be writing essays on the immorality of any
        barking whatever. By that time he would be wearing
        piccadilly collars and eye-glasses.</p>

    <p>Some day she would break loose and express herself.
        She had done so in a number of small things. Phew!
        How the good mater would carry on if she knew!</p>

    <p>For illustration, Gorgas gave a sketchy account of
        her holiday with Bardek. They had tramped across
        country to Chestnut Hill, and up the Whitemarsh Valley,
        where in a thick of young willows by the upper
        reaches of the Wissahickon they had struck camp.
        They built a fire and had luscious broiled chicken empaled
        on sticks—Bardek had negotiated for the chickens
        at a near-by farm house. For hours they lolled on
        the ground, Bardek’s thick coat serving as a protection
        from the damp earth, stirred the fire, and talked themselves
        out. They should have started for home, of
        course, but it was Gorgas who declined to go back, and
        Bardek had consoled himself with the sight of an occasional
        puffing train off beyond the trees; when they
        willed they could whisk back to Mount Airy in a half-hour
        or less.</p>

    <p>Then, as the warm sun was slanting warningly toward
        the west, Gorgas, prowling among the willows,
        came upon an amateur spring-board disclosing a swimming-hole,
        shut in from all the world. The day was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
        exceptionally warm, but when she shouted with delight
        and invited him to dare her to dive in, Bardek was wise
        enough to know the dangerous deception in the day and
        season, and ordered her most thunderously to do no
        such thing. And therein Bardek was not wise at all.
        She would not be ordered about by anyone, she had
        retorted angrily; she would do as she pleased; and when
        he strode forward, talking the while as if he were disciplining
        one of his youngsters, she plunged in. And
        just to show that she was master of herself, she had
        swum about deliberately in the tingling water until he
        changed his tone and pleaded with her to come out.</p>

    <p>That, of course, put trains out of the question. The
        miles to Mount Airy must be walked, and at a good
        pace, too. The stimulating chill of that water she
        recorded as one of the most satisfying shocks of her
        young experience; and the swift tramp homeward on
        an exquisitely warm April night was altogether good.</p>

    <p>Bardek, mindful of added trouble to Gorgas if the
        Leverings should glimpse him, discreetly dropped out
        at his white-washed cottage; so to Gorgas it was left
        to face the family alone. It was close to midnight.
        The Levering household was awake and watching, one
        might be sure, and full of silly speculation.</p>

    <p>There was a row, of course; but not a word of explanation
        from Gorgas. She answered questions with
        tantalizing vagueness, foraged for food and ate hungrily,
        but only stared like Ophelia at their admonitory
        speeches.</p>

    <p>Presently they noticed her closer resemblance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
        Ophelia, the damp hair, and presented the theory that
        she had fallen into the water. The thought of swimming
        in April did not occur to them. As that drew
        sympathy and a cessation of fault-finding she affected
        a clever shiver or two and was put to bed with much
        solicitude and a comforting drink of hot lemonade.
        At this hour she was presumed to be sleeping.</p>

    <p>What good would explanations have done? She
        asked Blynn. The net result had been good, physically,
        mentally and spiritually good. She had let loose struggling
        feeling and had the fine bounding recompense that
        always comes when mother nature says, Give. To tell
        the bare facts would be to tell a sort of untruth; certain
        persons—the plaster-of-paris sort—are incapable
        of receiving; preconceived notions of conduct have
        “set” them forever.</p>

    <p>Even this long letter, now coming to an abrupt close,
        was helpful and right. Nature had not said, Sleep—although
        she was saying it now, and mighty strong,
        too—but she had said, Give; write; tell Allen Blynn.
        And if Allen Blynn would mail his letters before ten
        o’clock at night Gorgas Levering would be the first to
        claim them in the morning. Spying over one’s letters
        would be the next thing to take up with the family!</p>

    <p>Allen Blynn’s reply was dispatched immediately and
        strictly according to mailing directions. It was in long-hand,
        a tacit sign hereafter of the distinction between
        public and private readings.</p>

    <p>The theme of his letter was freedom. To be free—that
        was the history of all human conflict and the goal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
        of civilization. He was with her so thoroughly in her
        attempt to be herself that she glowed with the spirit
        of vindicated right. Here was an “authority” giving
        her that necessary courage so much needed by those
        who fight alone.</p>

    <p>That was distinctly Blynn’s way with children, to
        start with agreement, gain loyalty, divert the terrific
        force of opposition—a pedagogic jiu-jitsu which
        turned all the energies his way.</p>

    <p>“But here we come to a puzzle,” he went on, “which
        nobody yet has satisfactorily solved. Obey your instincts?
        All right. It is a great principle. But which
        instincts? The instinct to assert the best that is in
        us? Oh, yes, indeed. The instinct to be strong, to
        produce worthily, to live without mental or physical
        pain? Undoubtedly. But should we give play to
        other instincts, too, equally natural and equally struggling
        to express themselves; the instinct to kill, for instance;
        to grovel; to run away; to save one’s skin at
        the expense of one’s ideas; to be unclean; to be slothful;
        diseased; to sneak and lie and bear false witness?
        I am not mentioning the worst ones, but if you were a
        man I could. No doubt you are old enough to have
        heard of some. In other words, there is a war among
        our most natural desires, and the game is to him who
        exercises the high, and atrophies the base in us. That’s
        the old quarrel over good and evil, the archangel of the
        Lord against Lucifer and his demons.</p>

    <p>“Whenever I feel most the desire to ‘break loose,’
        as you say, and have my momentary will, I think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
        certain creatures about me who have tried that game
        to the full,—the blear-eyed wretches who sun themselves
        in the parks or nod and drowse in the reading-rooms of
        the public libraries; and of that hunted-looking crew
        of hideous women who prowl the streets in ones and
        twos after nightfall. All of these were young and fair
        once, and laughed, and felt the call to be themselves.
        Think of it!</p>

    <p>“How can you judge where your desire will lead?
        The child would eat nothing but ice cream and cake.
        Some forlorn little kiddies, whom I meet in my journeys
        through the city, have been allowed to have their will.
        I see them satisfying their natural hunger craving while
        mothers look on complacently and permit the growth
        of a brood of malnutritioned youngsters. We wiser
        folks, passing by, we know the end. We are like
        prophets foreseeing calamity.</p>

    <p>“Well, what is to guide us? Wisdom. And how
        shall we know wisdom? That is hard, I admit; but
        some of it is found in the curbs and restrictions of
        society. The very repressions that gall you may be
        the law that keeps you from eventual destruction. Society
        is not always right, not by a jugful, and revolutionists
        there must be to amend and abolish. But one
        must have care. For the ancient régime one might unwittingly
        substitute The Terror.</p>

    <p>“Your letter has inspired me to write a parable.
        Half the morning I have been toiling over it, shaping
        and reshaping the phrases—is there any exercise more
        delightful! I have added to my joy by trying to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
        it into the stately English of Elizabeth, which even at
        its worst is touched with subtle beauty. It doesn’t satisfy
        just yet, so I shall wait.</p>

    <p>“The title is clear to me. ‘Ignorance.’ No one
        should feel hurt by the accusation of ignorance; it is
        the common mortal possession.</p>

    <p>“Before I close I must tell you more of my great
        mystery, ‘The Lady of the Interruption.’”</p>

    <p>After one has been very serious with children, he
        knew, it is always prudent to shift the topic abruptly,
        as if all that has been said has no personal application
        whatever.</p>

    <p>“She is present quite often at my extension lectures.
        Once or twice I have seen her distinctly, and have
        learned to look for my cues by her nods of approval
        or her smiling disdain. So far, she has not ‘interrupted’;
        but I am ready any moment. After the lecture
        we open the question-box and have a fifteen minute
        rapid answering of queries. Lately she has been asking
        questions, which, needless to say, I do not read
        aloud. Here is one.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“‘Don’t you think that a professor of English
            should take as much care in purchasing wearing apparel
            as he does in the selection of his phrases? Or do
            you believe that a hump at the back of the coat is essential
            to professional dignity; or that a white waistcoat
            for evening wear would be too undemocratic in a
            republic?’</p>
    </div>

    <p>“She has been hinting several times that my personal
        appearance could be improved without loss of vocal delivery!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
        Isn’t it the most eccentric thing you ever heard
        of? And the strangest part of it all is that I enjoy it.
        I find she is quite right in a number of points. I am
        a shabby beggar. The total effect has been to send
        me to a good tailor. Oh, we’re quite spruce, nowadays,
        I tell you! Her latest question was:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“‘You follow my suggestions, but you do not read
            my questions aloud. Be careful, or I shall expose you
            again.’</p>
    </div>

    <p>“Is she simply odd-brained, or a great humorist?
        Pray, put your mind to it. I’m tremendously interested.”</p>

    <p>It was not difficult for Gorgas to decide about the
        lady, but she did not write her full conclusions to Allen
        Blynn; if the lady were mad, there was method in it.
        What she did write was to inquire more about her appearance.
        Did she smile or look over-serious? Was
        she dark or light?</p>

    <p>Men are the most artless creatures, she thought;
        women could take outrageous liberties with them and
        they never suspect anything. And of all artless men,
        Allen Blynn was the easiest. He was so chivalrous, so
        ready to serve. A woman had but to say, “Sit by me
        and talk,” or, “Spend Wednesday afternoon with me,”
        and Allen would drop his dearest interest to do the
        lady’s bidding; and with such flattering attention, too.</p>

    <p>The “Lady of the Interruption” was going to needless
        lengths to capture the services of Allen Blynn,
        Gorgas thought. How easy to see through her ruse;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
        although one had to admit that she was a daring creature,
        and intelligent, too. One could not help admiring
        her supreme nerve. Undoubtedly, she was “expressing
        herself,” and defying all that same code of society
        which forbids a young woman to debate in public.</p>

    <p>A day or two later a typewritten letter, obviously
        for family reading, came to Gorgas, containing the
        simple statement that he thought the Leverings might
        be interested in the enclosed bit of writing.</p>

    <p class="center">A PARABLE OF IGNORANCE</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>His turban was a strange purple, and his gown was
            the orange of the dust of the road; and in his hand
            he bore no staff but a branch of wild grape. Although
            he had travelled far, yet was his face white; white like
            those hermits that dwell apart in caves; white was he
            as the live white of the growing lily, as the pallor of
            the moon in daylight; and the men and women of the
            city marvelled, for they were a dark people that
            worked in the furrows of the earth and lived daily in
            the sun.</p>

        <p>Now the stranger would have passed on, but they
            came out from the gates of their city to gaze upon him.
            Some stood in the way and hindered, some touched
            reverently the hem of his robe, and many besought him
            to enter into their houses and stay with them.</p>

        <p>But he said unto them, A wanderer have I been all
            the days of my manhood and must fare alone; although
            best of all things I love friends and companionship.
            And he would have turned back, even at the gate of
            the city, but they pressed him to come among them, if
            only for a little while. Friends, they cried, thou shalt
            have an abundance; for here everyone worketh with his
            hands in the fields, and each is neighbor to another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
            And he hearkened to them and said no word, but looked
            upon them as one with great longing. So he tarried
            with them.</p>

        <p>And straightway some among them began to toil
            less in the heat of the day, and some wove coverings of
            straw to keep their faces from the light of the sun; and
            they said to one another in the market-place, How
            beautiful is the whiteness of the face and the hands of
            him that stooped to come among us. We are a rough
            people, dark of skin; from of old have we toiled with
            our hands and have lifted up our faces daily to the
            burning heavens, and see what it hath profited us.
            Would that we were as the holy man is.</p>

        <p>Then went some to him in the night and told of their
            great desire to be as he. And one who was nearest him
            said unto him, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy comeliness
            lieth and wherewith we might be as thou art.
            And when they one and all pressed upon him to say
            wherewith they might be as he, he smiled and regarded
            them with great tenderness.</p>

        <p>Yet he passed his hands over the faces of those whom
            he loved, and blessed them, and, behold, they lost their
            roughness and became smooth and fair and of the
            whiteness of the clouds of heaven.</p>

        <p>And one by one to each as he asked he laid his hands
            upon the brow and upon the cheek and upon the lips
            and upon the strong limbs, and blessed them, and they
            became as the Wanderer was, and went away rejoicing
            at the miracle wrought upon their bodies.</p>

        <p>Much honor, they offered him, even silver and jewels;
            but none of these would he have save the daily bread
            and wine, claiming only their friendliness.</p>

        <p>And when the day came that he had set for his departure,
            there was much sorrow, so that the Wanderer
            tarried longer. And again and again was the day put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
            off until he had sojourned with them a full twelfth-month.
            The day of his coming they named for a holy
            day and the year of that day they celebrated with
            feasting and thanksgiving, for now few of them were
            not fair.</p>

        <p>But on the evening of that day the Wanderer fell
            ill; and he called about him those who had been chiefly
            his companions, and said, I am to die. But they cried
            aloud that it could not be; that they whom he had comforted
            would comfort him also; that as he had ministered
            unto them so would they to him. Of a surety,
            they said, he would live to be strong again and, in the
            fullness of time, see age come with honor.</p>

        <p>But he answered, I am to die. I am to die, he said,
            and turned his face quietly to the wall, quietly as of
            one who had finished a good task and was content.</p>

        <p>Thereupon they besought him to tell them what they
            might do to save him, to which of his gods they might
            pray and offer sacrifice. And he turned and answered.
            Of all earthly things, best loved I friends and companionship.
            These ye have given me in abundance. Yet
            am I to die; for surely ye have known all this while, as
            ye turned me from my journey and led me through the
            gates of your city, as ye gave me of the bread and
            wine, as ye visited me and comforted me daily with
            friendliness; surely ye knew as ye begged the secret of
            my comeliness and bade me lay my hands upon thy
            brow, thy cheek, your lips and your strong limbs,
            surely ye knew: I am a leper.</p>

            TOBOGGANING</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">NED MORRIS’ behavior toward Gorgas underwent
        a decided change. His tone grew discreet
        and secretive and intimate; he seemed
        forever smirking, as if charged with unexpressed humor,
        the possessor of a private joke.</p>

    <p>“Good morning, sweetheart,” he would whisper his
        greeting, although it might be evening.</p>

    <p>And she would look up from her work with equal appreciation
        of the common jest and remark, “Merry
        Christmas, pretty boy,” but go on with her work.</p>

    <p>When others were present he gave no sign, but so
        soon as the two were alone he hovered near, playing the
        open swain, but purely a dramatic rôle. It was very
        amusing. Gorgas liked the drama and the spirit in
        which it was played.</p>

    <p>As she hammered he would sing an air from the new
        Robin Hood, “Churning, churning, churning, all the
        live-long day,” and act beautifully the tipsy sheriff of
        Nottingham. Or he would plead with mock mournfulness,
        “Oh, promise me that some day you and I will
        take our love together ’neath some sky,” and so forth.</p>

    <p>Dangerous topics kept coming to the fore in their
        conversation, dangerous with stirring April in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
        pulse of things, and two healthy youngsters alone together.
        Ned seemed to have ample afternoons to give.
        He was third year medical school, which should have
        meant work, but he claimed to have everything “stowed
        away” for the May finals. At any rate, the spring
        recess was near at hand; he could “plug up” then.</p>

    <p>They tried out the courts on fine days. The ground
        was still soft, but by dint of much rolling they managed
        to get some practice; most of the time, however, they sat
        on the bench in the sun, and, warmly wrapped in woolens,
        breathed the exquisite air and talked. He grew dexterous
        in putting sleeves into coats, playing gentleman-in-waiting,
        and while ordinarily she resented anyone
        touching her, she found herself enjoying these little
        signs of fond care of her.</p>

    <p>He had been smoothing out a collar and tucking a
        “sweater” snugly back of her ears, carefully brushing
        away the hair, and tapping each little ear jokingly.
        Meanwhile he had drawn out a log for her feet and with
        the aid of a steamer-rug had tucked her in comfortably.</p>

    <p>“I feel like a mummy,” she laughed, and bathed contentedly
        in the warm sun.</p>

    <p>“You look like a seraph,” he eyed her critically.</p>

    <p>“Seraphs don’t have feet,” she corrected.</p>

    <p>“What!” he exclaimed. “Don’t tell me that! Nor
        little, fat, brown ears, either?”</p>

    <p>“Nope.”</p>

    <p>“Nor crinkly, brown hair what won’t stay fixed?”
        he deftly put back a fluttering strand.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“Nope.”</p>

    <p>“Nor soft, mellow voices what sez ‘nope’?”</p>

    <p>“Nope; they always toot through trumpets—or is
        it shawms?”</p>

    <p>“Well, I’ll be dinged!” he swore.</p>

    <p>“You’re quite likely to be.”</p>

    <p>“All right,” cheerfully, “let’s be dinged together?
        Eh? What y’say?”</p>

    <p>“Mebbe; how do you begin?”</p>

    <p>“<i>Facilis descensus Averni</i>,” he suggested.</p>

    <p>“Talk a language I understand,” but she quite understood
        that stale Latin quotation, “Easy is the road
        down.”</p>

    <p>“That is to say,” Morris cast about for a translation.
        “‘Let her go, Gallagher, and boomp! you’re at
        the bottom!’ Let’s—uh—let’s toboggan?”</p>

    <p>He slipped a hand under the steamer-rug and grasped
        her wrist.</p>

    <p>She considered for a moment or two, but she gave no
        answering touch.</p>

    <p>“You’re dead cold,” he withdrew and chirped gaily.
        “No blood in you. You couldn’t <i>descensus</i> for a cent.
        What you need is a series of stiff lessons.”</p>

    <p>“Isn’t this just jim-dandy,” she murmured, ignoring
        his talk. “Golly! It’s good sometimes to be just
        alive.” He grew quiet. “I heard all you said, Neddie.
        I’m not inattentive. Go on and talk. I like to
        hear you prattle. But I’m so comforty. I don’t want
        to think.... And it’s so nice to be taken care of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
        tucked in, and all that.” She kicked out a foot.
        “There! It’s out again. Be a good boy and fix the
        mummy’s legs.”</p>

    <p>“And he fixed them up so care-ful-ee,” he sang as he
        worked, “That now he’s the ruler of the Queen’s
        nav-ee.”</p>

    <p>He smoked and they both lapsed into silence, while
        his eyes watched her with frank approval.</p>

    <p>“Women like to be helpless,” she spoke out the summing
        up of her thinking. “I always thought I despised
        those frail beseeching-looking things that hang
        around like dolls and let men fetch and carry for them.
        I always did for myself—usually could do it better
        than any man; but lately, I’ve got a case of the ‘delicates.’
        You’re responsible, Neddie; you’ve been taking
        such delicious care of me that I have succumbed. ‘Let
        her go, Gallagher and boomp! I’m at the bottom.’
        Just tuck in that flapping hair, won’t you? I don’t
        want to move.”</p>

    <p>A dutiful and faithful squire Morris became; and no
        one thought anything of it. Mrs. Levering frequently
        came to the “smitty” to watch the work or to chat
        with Gorgas about little teas and small receptions that
        kept an informal atmosphere moving in the neighborhood;
        Gorgas was clever in thinking up original things,
        decorations and so on. Ned’s presence was accepted
        as a matter of course. Had he not grown up in the
        neighborhood, and were not he and Gorgas perpetual
        tennis partners? But it is doubtful if she ever asked
        herself even so much as that; her serene assumption of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
        the careful mother had annihilated all thinking on the
        subject.</p>

    <p>“My daughters,” she confessed to a caller who was
        interested in seeing the “smitty,” “are pretty much
        about what I planned. It is almost wholly a question
        of management, I think. For instance, I decided that
        Keyser should like music. She rebelled, naturally; but
        I held her to it—my will was the stronger. Now she
        plays rather nicely, I think; and she’s very grateful, I
        can tell, for my insistence. Gorgas has been a trial, I
        must say; but look how she has come around! There
        was a time when we could hardly have a decent conversation
        together,” she laughed, “but now we’re quite
        chums.</p>

    <p>“And then there’s that awful question of boys. I
        have never had the question. For us it just doesn’t
        exist. My scheme is very simple. I keep a lot of
        social things going on right at home; the girls have a
        good time, and I know everything that is happening.”</p>

    <p>While Mrs. Levering talked, Ned Morris was saying
        pretty nothings in Gorgas’ ear.</p>

    <p>“It seems to me, young man,” Gorgas told him in a
        secretive undertone, “that you are making the right
        speech to the wrong party. Bea Wilcox is the young
        lady who should have patent rights on that kind of
        talk. Or have you broken off?”</p>

    <p>Ned made a wry face. “Friday nights,” he said,
        “I pay my addresses to the lady. Mother’s an awful
        stickler. You have to go home at ten o’clock, the time
        they unchain the mastiff. Broken off? Not exactly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
        Sort of mangled. Bea’s nasty lately. Can’t make her
        out. But this isn’t Bea’s party; I’m talking to your
        right ear.”</p>

    <p>“The right ear is heartily ashamed of you,” she
        turned completely around. “Try the left ear; it’s not
        used to you yet.”</p>

    <p>So they chatted nonsense and—drifted.</p>

    <p>When the mother had gone she brushed him aside
        and took up a mallet.</p>

    <p>“You are keeping me from my work,” she protested,
        but not with much force.</p>

    <p>“Aw; you don’t want to work. You’re just bluffing.
        How can you pretend to work on days like these?”</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, she began a gentle rhythmic tapping.</p>

    <p>“‘Churning, churning, churning all the live-long
        day,’” Ned sang, keeping time to the beats. Leaning
        over he took hold of the handle, closed his hand
        over hers, and continued the singing. She joined in
        the second part, and laughingly enacted the rôle of the
        milk-maid where the sheriff aims to instruct Guy of
        Gisbond into the mysteries of courting. The scene
        ends with the sheriff drawing closer and closer until he
        turns to implant a kiss on the dairy-maid.</p>

    <p>Gorgas ducked half-successfully, and gave the timidest
        imitation of a slap. In the wrestling that ensued
        she became somewhat flushed and disheveled, and Ned’s
        soft collar was wrenched quite buttonless; so that, although
        the warning of Mrs. Levering and her guest returning
        gave ample time for a quick recovery of the
        mallet, it allowed no opportunity for anything else.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“My dear,” the mother’s voice was solicitous, “I’m
        afraid you’re working too hard this morning. Don’t
        overdo it. You look positively done up. Don’t you
        think you had better lie down and rest, dear?”</p>

    <p>Gorgas held herself in check and answered properly
        and dutifully, but volumes of pent-up laughter threatened
        to explode. The situation was made especially
        tense by the comic expression of sadness assumed by
        Morris—it seemed to convey a mountain of sympathy
        for the hard lot of the workwoman—and by the idiotic
        smile of sympathy from the stupid guest. Any person
        with half an eye could have seen that these two young
        persons had been tussling together.</p>

    <p>Only the severest restraint held them in check until
        Mrs. Levering had piloted her visitor out of the
        “smitty” and into the front garden. Then the two
        culprits sprawled on the work-bench and laughed themselves
        into hiccoughs.</p>

    <p>“What fools these elderly mortals be,” was Morris’
        comment, on partial recovery. “They don’t know a
        hawk from a hand organ. ‘Oh, Gorgie, deah,’” he
        mimicked. “‘Are you suah you are not working too
        hahd?’”</p>

    <p>When Bardek came in an hour later he found Gorgas
        and Ned sitting together on the big settle. Gorgas
        had her sleeve turned back and a handkerchief bound to
        her arm. He gave one careful look at them, walked
        quickly over to Gorgas’ bench, inspected the progress
        made, and softly whistled.</p>

    <p>“We’re discussing important matters, Bardek,” Gorgas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
        explained. The sly twinkle in his eye was not to
        be endured passively. “Ned’s telling me about his
        medical courses.”</p>

    <p>Bardek whistled a strange, unfinished bar.</p>

    <p>“Tell it to t’e marines,” he nodded significantly.</p>

    <p>“Honest, Bardek,” Ned assured him. “I was showing
        her how we bandage in emergencies without proper
        material at hand.”</p>

    <p>“Rats!” Bardek exulted at his ability to use the
        prevailing lingo. A moment later, he added, “If Miss
        Gorgas ever finish zat order,” jerking his arm toward
        her bench, “Neddie must soon make ’not’er home-run,
        eh?”</p>

    <p>“Hug the bag; pitcher’s got the ball!” Morris retorted.</p>

    <p>“Look out for a steal!” put in Gorgas over her
        shoulder.</p>

    <p>“There he goes!” shouted Ned. “Slide! slide!...
        Safe by a mile!”</p>

    <p>“Somebody coach third,” called Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“Vairy good,” agreed Bardek, who was quite aware
        that all this nonsense was aimed at him. “Vairy good.
        That talk I do not know; but I know some t’ings.”
        He marched toward the door. “I not so <i>beeg</i> a fool
        to stand around and stop nice little boy-girl love-making.
        <i>Je n’aime pas à faire le fâcheux troisieme.</i> I
        know when three is one too many! <i>Au revoir, les enfants!</i>”
        and he was gone.
    </p>

    <p>The effect was sobering.</p>

    <p>“The blithering fool!” ejaculated Gorgas.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Off in the distance they could hear Bardek singing
        lustily.</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="verse">“Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!</div>
            <div class="verse">“Quel bon petit roi c’était là! là! là!”</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“Oh, he’s a wise boy, all right,” commented Ned.
        “<i>He</i> knows a hawk from a hand organ, O. K.”</p>

    <p>“Hush!” Gorgas shook a finger under his nose.
        “That’s not the proper way to talk. We’re not—”</p>

    <p>“Aren’t we?... Then let’s!”</p>

    <p>She tried to gather her thoughts together. If this
        had been almost any other man, some chap she didn’t
        know like a brother, she would have sent him about
        his business instanter. But Ned was such a familiar
        figure, like a bit of accustomed furniture. One was so
        thoroughly used to him and his nonsense that much
        could be allowed without offence. Her mind would not
        face the real situation, however; it fought away from
        it for fear of stopping things.</p>

    <p>Love-making? Nonsense.... What was it, then?...
        Oh, bother! Don’t think about it. Just let
        things go. “Let her go, Gallagher! and boomp! we’re
        at the bottom.”</p>

    <p>There was nothing wrong in just drifting comfortably
        through new experiences. Ned didn’t mean anything.
        He was as good as engaged to Bea. But was
        this fair to Bea?... Oh, shucks! Why take up disagreeable
        topics?... Hang Bardek, anyway....
        He spoilt all the fun.... It made them both self-conscious.</p>

    <p>Ned was sitting on the arm of the settle, affecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
        to smooth out the bandage on her arm, but she knew
        he was not doing that at all. She was leaning against
        him. Perhaps she ought to get up and clear him out.
        But she did no such thing. It was very comforty,
        there.</p>

    <p>It was more than comforty; of that she became
        aware when his head leaned over quietly and his face
        pressed against her temples. She could feel his hand
        tremble, and she knew that her face was burning with
        the touch of his.</p>

    <p>She did not move away, but she said quietly, “Why
        do you do this, Ned? It isn’t right, and you know it.”</p>

    <p>“Why?” his voice shook.</p>

    <p>“There’s Bea.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, Bea’s all right,” he parried.</p>

    <p>“Are you going to marry Bea?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I guess so; forget it. Let’s—let’s just toboggan.”</p>

    <p>She closed her eyes and let the thrill of the contact
        suffuse her.</p>

    <p>“But you don’t care—” she struggled to see the
        thing straight.</p>

    <p>“<i>Don’t</i> I?”</p>

    <p>“And neither do I. We’re just good friends, like
        brother and sister. And we’re letting something get
        hold of us and make us wild.”</p>

    <p>“All right. Let her go, Gallagher—” he chuckled.</p>

    <p>“But how can we? It isn’t—love-making at all!...
        What is it?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“I don’t know and I don’t care. I didn’t invent this
        thing.... We’re just human, I suppose.”</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering’s voice could be heard calling for Mac.
        The two riotous young hearts beat violently at the sudden
        thought of detection; but they did not stir.</p>

    <p>Fear shook her; if the mother had quietly opened
        the door before them and stared, in combined astonishment
        and indignation, Gorgas felt that she should be
        unable to get up. It was the sensation of dreams
        where we are about to be devoured by some hideous
        beast, yet can neither cry out nor move.</p>

    <p>“Suppose mother should walk in that door!” she
        whispered. “That’s the way she always comes—from
        the house.”</p>

    <p>“It’s locked,” he whispered back. There was no
        cause for the lower voice, save sheer excitement.</p>

    <p>After a moment she asked, “How do you know?”</p>

    <p>“I locked it myself.”</p>

    <p>“When?”</p>

    <p>“When she went out.... I slipped the bolt....
        Let’s forget about it.”</p>

    <p>From her silence he caught the need of making some
        defense.</p>

    <p>“Maybe it isn’t love-making,” he argued. “I think
        it isn’t, myself. It’s a fair exchange, and therefore
        robs nobody.”</p>

    <p>She did not move away, but she had not surrendered.
        Off in the depths of her mind something was striving to
        be heard. It seemed like long strings of sentences, too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
        far off to be deciphered, marching, marching, in an undulating
        line over hill and valley, hurrying to her aid.
        She smiled as she recalled Mark Twain’s picture of the
        German language sprawling in that same fashion with
        a separable verb tacked on the end.</p>

    <p>“I didn’t mean to do this,” he poured in her ear.
        “It was not in my thoughts until you put it there
        that day you and I talked about the ‘frat’ pin. Since
        then I have been aching to—do this. It’s nature.
        It’s just instinct, I suppose.”</p>

    <p>Instinct! That was it. The marching line of
        words came clearly into view now. “There are good
        instincts and bad instincts,” it shouted at her.
        “Which will you have? Take your choice. The
        archangel of the Lord offers you one; Lucifer and his
        demons offer you another. Choose; and be exalted or
        forever damned.”</p>

    <p>She twisted his arms from around her and got up.</p>

    <p>“We’re both a little mad, I think.” She steadied
        herself and looked away from his eager eyes. “This
        won’t do. No!” She faced him and pushed him
        away. “Stop it, I tell you. I’m awake now. For a
        minute or two I was drunk.... What a storm you
        raised in me, Neddie Morris!... Oof! Let’s get out
        of here and breathe some air. I’m suffocated.”</p>

    <p>For the remainder of that day she was obdurate.
        He was not permitted to touch her. Eventually he became
        bitter, tried unsuccessfully to quarrel with her,
        and finally left her in a huff.</p>

    <p>And she was not ashamed. That was the oddest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
        consequence, she thought. There was nothing, then, to
        tell her whether this instinct was a good or a bad one.
        It had seemed so right and natural, and—this she reluctantly
        confessed—it had been absolutely satisfactory.</p>

    <p>She recalled the eager people who begged of the
        pale stranger to sojourn with them. How beautiful
        he must have appeared to them, just as this first experience
        was beautiful. Ignorance of the obvious had
        blinded their eyes as it now blinded hers. Leprosy!
        Hideous! But the “tobogganing,” what else did it lead
        to? She knew enough of her sisterhood to be aware
        of the wages eventually paid.</p>

    <p>Almost the last touch of girlhood went from her
        that hour. Maturity lurked in her eyes as never before;
        in her step and carriage, even in the tones of
        her voice. The last trace of awkwardness in gait and
        speech disappeared, vanished suddenly. The ship had
        found herself and was surging through the tossing
        seas. Slight as the experience had been, it had not
        been slight in its effects. It gave her a kind of pride,
        as of one who had achieved something; and,—what
        strange thoughts go packed together!—it filled her
        with understanding sympathy for all wayward women.
        From that hour, another odd result, she became her
        mother’s intimate and friend. There were no more
        “rows”; and, so inconsistent a thing is memory, no
        one seemed to remember that Gorgas had ever been a
        difficult problem in the family.</p>

    <p>And Ned? After a few days he adjusted himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
        to the changed situation; and, man-like, forgot that
        it had occurred. His medical studies began to pull
        him—when one interest is out, others always take
        its place—and the old jollity of manner came racing
        back.</p>

    <p>Almost at their next encounter, over which Gorgas
        had been a little fearful, he met her eagerly with:</p>

    <p>“Say, old girl, Bea treats me like a civilized compatriot
        now. Don’t see what she ever went on a strike
        for. I hadn’t done anything. Honest! Nothing that
        I know of. Well, she’s forgiven me for doing nothing
        and all’s hunky-dory.... She thinks you know. Say,
        be a good girl and make her tell you. She’s dying to
        talk it out with you; but she’s afraid. Sort of nervous
        and shy, you know.... Oh, she’s O. K. and A1, that
        little girl.”</p>

    <p>What comic animals we are, she thought as she
        searched his eyes and saw there nothing but loyalty to
        the other woman. Do not the high gods sometimes hold
        their hands to their faces and smile?...</p>

    <p>Let her go, Gallagher, and, boomp! we’re at the
        bottom....</p>

    <p>Surely ye knew.... <i>I am a leper!</i>...</p>

    <p>What a topic of conversation for Allen Blynn
        when he comes down for the Easter holidays. How
        much should she tell? It depended much on what sort
        of a debate they could manage to have together. Several
        apocryphal versions she thought out and discarded.
        The best of them was a hypothetical case of
        a girl who had confessed. Certainly she would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
        the courage to talk the affair out boldly with Allen
        Blynn. Not that she felt the least guilt, but any telling
        would, somehow, be unfair to the facts. Who
        could transmute into puffed vocables the rich data of
        life? It would be like transposing a cumulus cloud-bank
        into a major chord. The life and the autobiography
        are never the same.</p>

    <p>When Allen Blynn came she managed to secure a
        large share of his time; but even the third cousin of
        the topic was not broached. Her voice fled from all
        suggestion of anything so personal; possibly because
        he looked so much older and stronger: his forehead
        seemed to bulge more, his voice had grown heavier, and
        new little muscles began to show about his mouth, signs
        of much public speaking. Instead, she plied him with
        questions about Holden, with which she felt only a remote
        interest.</p>

    <p>And they talked of the mysterious lady. Blynn grew
        gay at the thought of her.</p>

    <p>“I’m hot on her trail,” he assured her. “When I
        go for her at the close of the lecture, she slips out.
        She is always at the end of the hall. And no one
        knows her. I have questioned dozens of persons who
        have been sitting near.”</p>

    <p>“She watches you, I suppose, while you talk?”
        Gorgas asked.</p>

    <p>“Tremendously! She leans forward and fixes me
        with her eyes. I think they must be black. Even
        across a big hall they burn at me.”</p>

    <p>“Doesn’t it bother you?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“Shouldn’t you expect it to? But it doesn’t. I
        get positive strength from her. She is the most attentive
        person I ever address. Every twist of her head
        is eloquent; I can catch the register of the value of
        everything I say. But I must get to know her better.
        She has ideas; no doubt of that; or I dream she has.
        And perhaps I am under some obligation to her.
        Someone has recently presented me with a mighty valuable
        book. It is a first edition, in good condition, too,
        of the second series of Bacon’s essays. Of course, I
        only guess that she sent it. It had my name on the
        cover, in a script that resembles hers. It was left in my
        room, too. Someone must have walked in and placed
        it on the table.... Which reminds me that I have a
        book for you.”</p>

    <p>“Let’s see it.”</p>

    <p>“Not until September 10th.”</p>

    <p>“My birthday!”</p>

    <p>“Yes. It is a first edition, and the only copy made.”</p>

    <p>“It must be very valuable,” her eyes opened.</p>

    <p>“It is to me. I hope it may be to you. I can tell
        you this much, I wrote it myself—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, splendid! The MS. of a book! I shall be delighted.
        What a nice kind of present.”</p>

    <p>“I hope you will think so,” he rumpled his hair
        comically. “I’ve put a lot into it—five years. But
        that’s all I’m going to tell you,” he foresaw her question.
        “Birthday gifts are secrets.... You won’t
        tell anybody about it, will you?”</p>

    <p>She agreed. What girl does not hug a secret?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“But oh, Allen Blynn, why did you tell me in April?
        I shall wear myself out thinking— Is it fiction?”
        beaming.</p>

    <p>“Bless my soul, no!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, a book on literature!” mildly enthusiastic.</p>

    <p>“No-o.”</p>

    <p>“Pedagogy?” mournfully.</p>

    <p>“Certainly not!”</p>

    <p>“Essays?” brightening up.</p>

    <p>“Here, stop this; I’ll be giving it away in a minute.
        I won’t say another word. Wait.”</p>

    <p>May, June, July, August, September; five months of
        guessing. How delightful—and how wicked!</p>

        <h3 class="nobreak">XX<br>

            A CONNOISSEUR OF JOY</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">BARDEK and his family had done astonishingly
        well with the “boards and plaster” of their
        white-washed cottage. It had been something
        more than a novel experience; genuine domestic roots
        had sprouted and held him. Assisted in emergencies
        by Mrs. Mac, the young wife fell into the ways of
        other women with remarkable instinctiveness, and the
        two babies flourished into rugged boyhood, went to bed
        like other lads, swam, quarreled and played miniature
        baseball with the neighbors’ children.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the workshop held Bardek more than anything
        else; but he never ceased to marvel at his own
        surrender.</p>

    <p>“I let myself, I, Bardek,” he would exclaim with
        comic seriousness, “be tied up like dog with chain.”</p>

    <p>But he broke loose many times. Without notice he
        would be off; the little white cottage would give forth
        no sounds of singing or scrubbing; the children’s shrill
        voices would cease. One need not then bother further
        about Bardek for many days. Perhaps the doors would
        be closed, but the windows rarely; and often the wash
        was left flapping on the line. It was Mrs. Mac’s eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
        that saw that everything was put shipshape after one
        of these abrupt exoduses.</p>

    <p>“It is good to be away,” on his return Bardek would
        say as he dropped his pack before the door and sniffed
        at the well-scrubbed pine floors and took in the general
        clean-up which Mrs. Mac could not refuse to an untidy
        dwelling. “The kennel gets in the nose; then one must
        gnaw the rope and be off and get new scents, and so
        to come back glad to the old. Ah! Nature is a great
        sweetener and cleaner. Ach! It is good to sit on
        hard chair! And how strong and fine smell the
        boards!”</p>

    <p>And Mrs. Mac would lean in the doorway and listen
        to his sighs of satisfaction; and her eyes and her red
        cheeks would glow with pride.</p>

    <p>Bardek would come back with something more than
        a nostalgia for boards and plaster; splendid orders he
        would bring for his own special work, and enough for
        Gorgas to keep her busy and prosperous. After one
        of these journeys there would be much excitement in
        the “smitty.” The lamp would burn at night. A
        clean spot would be cleared, the drawing boards would
        come down, and design would flourish.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>And now once more had Bardek quietly decamped,
        silently stole away like the Arabs.</p>

    <p>His pilgrimage was prolonged far beyond the usual
        hegira. April became May and May gave place to
        June, but no intimation came of the Bohemians. Mrs.
        Mac had time to give the cottage a complete house-cleaning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
        and Mac put new whitewash everywhere, on
        the broad boards that made the frame and on all the
        posts, and on the chicken-houses, and on the long, low
        fence which encircled the garden. Backed by a perfect
        mass of green shrubs and trees, and with a mighty
        Norway maple sheltering all, the little cottage cried out
        with welcome, but remained vacant.</p>

    <p>Gorgas found herself almost helpless without the
        daily consultations with the master. At first she put
        things aside unfinished, hoping against an early return,
        but as the days lengthened into summer and the white
        cottage remained tenantless, she was forced to work
        out her problems alone. It was a dreary task, lacking
        the companionship of that bubbling cosmopolitan.
        How much he meant to her! Hardly had she realized
        that before. Just before he left, he had seemed moody
        and disappointed. She resolved to be kinder to him;
        to cease having jokes at his expense. Their baseball
        slang seemed to annoy him; or was he joking, too?
        One never could tell.</p>

    <p>He was rarely angry, but once she had seen the inner
        ferocity of the man. A group of Italian railway laborers,
        sauntering by the “smitty” where they had no
        right to be, had stopped to peer in at the odd spectacle
        of a girl blowing a forge.</p>

    <p>They talked in their own tongue. It was an unfamiliar
        patois to Gorgas; although she could comprehend
        their general meaning. Their guttural interrogation
        changed to amusement; references to the young
        woman became pointed and finally personal. They saw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
        far off in the corner, the thick-set man tapping gently
        at his bench, but they rested secure in what they were
        accustomed to find an incomprehensible speech. One
        quiet utterance from a beady-eyed youth, who led the
        others in the doorway, set the company in gusts of
        laughter, which was followed by a clatter of attempts
        to imitate their bold companion.</p>

    <p>From the depths of the “smitty” the roaring voice
        of Bardek was suddenly heard calling upon them in their
        own tongue to run for their lives. A flying mallet
        crashed against the door-post and rebounded off to the
        leader’s shoulder. Almost before they could comprehend
        the curses hurled at them, the flaming form of
        Bardek appeared in the doorway, breathing carefully
        chosen Italian. Blows he rained upon them and kicks,
        delivered with precision. In terrified rout they scattered,
        straight through Mac’s perfect garden and over
        the fence, carrying part of it with them. Had anyone
        faltered he would probably have been killed.</p>

    <p>It was a half-hour before Bardek subsided; and all
        the while he had bubbled Italian. Finally, little
        chuckles of deep laughter came in flurries to the surface.
        The voluble cries and prayers of the retreating
        Italians he repeated, first with irony, then with full
        comprehension of their comic possibilities.</p>

    <p>“I must have care,” he warned himself. “Inside I
        am the big, sacred, mad bull of the old Greek, Dionusos.
        It is foolishness. To roar and kill, and for hot words,
        little harmless words, puffs of silly wind. For just
        that a man may give up a great fine life which the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
        Lord has made.... When I was jus’ a man I bellow
        like that, in Wien it was, and the man was big, a great
        Austrian.... We fight, and all for words. He speak
        against the France, and I have jus’ come from the
        France, and inside am I all French.” Bardek considered
        for a moment. “It was a bad day for that big
        Austrian when he speak against the France.... <i>Eh
            bien</i>, for that I am here!... Well, <i>le bon Dieu</i>,” he
        shrugged, “he it is, not Bardek, who manages.”</p>

    <p>But Bardek was not back, even to tease with American
        slang, Bardek who hovered over her with eloquent
        eye, who hungered to touch her, to smooth her forehead
        and grip her to him, but who ever remained aloof,
        a picture of magnificent restraint. Somehow, she
        hardly dared touch him herself, she who was so free
        with the others that came about the “smitty.” The
        mad bull of the old Greek, Dionusos, seemed sometimes
        as if it needed only a resting of the hand on the arm
        to give signal for a wild devouring.</p>

    <p>“I am just like his child,” she mused, “and—I must
        be honest—he is more my father than my father. It
        is wretched that we can’t show our affection in some
        human way.... <i>Nom d’une pipe!</i> Why does he not
        come back!... He must stop this gallivanting; I just
        can’t stand it.”</p>

    <p>One splendid June morning, as she plodded listlessly
        over her bench, an answer came to her call. It was
        the familiar voice of two noisy children disputing in
        French over the possession of the drinking dipper. In
        the house they heard only German; outside, the speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
        was French; on the long pilgrimages and on daily
        prowlings with the father through Cresheim, the language
        was Italian. The back-yard being undisputed
        French territory the little Bohemians were “tutoyéing”
        most belligerently.</p>

    <p>“Bardek!” shouted Gorgas. “Bardek!” she cried,
        and was out of the door and over the white fence.</p>

    <p>“Là! là! <i>là!</i> là! mon enfant!” he shouted in reply.
        “I come; like the <i>la grande vitesse</i>, quick I come!”</p>

    <p>Into each other’s arms they rushed. He swung her
        around and kissed her hair and cried over her like a
        veteran of the war returning safe to his children. Before
        she could recover, the boys had grabbed her knees,
        and the ordinarily stolid Lady Bardek had swooped
        upon her with much bubbling of Hungarian and weepings
        and wet kissings.</p>

    <p>Bardek pulsated language. One would never, never
        go away again! Oh, it was so good to be home!
        Never, never, would one go away again; not until the
        next time—eh, what?—until the soul grew sick with
        sameness and ran away for the pleasure of coming
        back. How could one get such joy without the suffering
        of absence? How do you know what you love
        until you try for one little while to give it up? The
        white-faced bald heads who keep, keep, keep; ah! what
        do they have—nothing. Life is rhythm, not stillness;
        back and forth, give up and take back, so swing
        the tides of earth and the bountiful blessings of heaven.</p>

    <p>“I,” cried Bardek, striking a pose, “I am the connoisseur
        of joy. It is not given to the rich to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
        happy, nor to the poor; both can be very miserable.
        I have studied and know the secret of living. Here is
        one of my secrets: When you love most, make it a
        grand sacrifice; go away; desert; fly for your life from
        that which gives life, and some day when you are far
        away, you hear the cry for you, oh! such a pitiful tenderness,
        it make you weep—inside. Have you loved?
        Oh, you thought yes. But now you know; never have
        you believed to love so much. Inside you have been
        cleaned out, burned dry, made ready to receive the
        blessing.... Then you come back. Rush fast?
        Right away? Oh, <i>non! non! non!</i> You wait. You
        suffer some little more. It is necessary. Soon you
        cannot rest where you are. But yet you do not rush;
        you hold fast and slip slow, slow, toward ‘home.’ Exquisite!
        The passion of going nearer, nearer! Each
        day the miles on the sign-post say littler and littler.
        Now it is sixty mile; now it is only forty-t’ree; now it
        is ten’s and five’s and two’s. You see all the home
        things, the skies and the grass and the cows and the—ach!
        <i>Gott im Himmel</i>, I cannot say it.... <i>Ein tousand
            ein hundred ein und zwanzig!</i> I am full of the
        joy. It is too much!”
    </p>

    <p>Everybody wept gloriously. It was the feast of
        tears, a celebration of the joy that cometh in the morning.
        And they laughed and they talked and they ran
        through the little house and admired and patted and
        loved and kissed even the clean white crockery.</p>

    <p>“You have miss me, eh?” Bardek eyed her with confidence.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>Gorgas nodded.</p>

    <p>“Ah, my child,” he patted her cheek, “now you
        know, too.... It was pain, was it not? Ah, yes.
        It must be. <i>Qui sait aimer sait mourir.</i> But ah! what
        would you give for your suffering? Eh? Nothings!
        The pain is part of the joy!”</p>

    <p>Bardek came back with something more than accumulative
        joy; he brought cash for work done and
        orders for more. New York city had evidently been
        on the route of his travels, for a famous firm of jewelers
        was on his list. One knew better than to question
        Bardek either about his journeys or about his past.
        “Only the old and the foolish chew over again the
        past,” he would say. “I have been; it is part of me;
        you see it all in my face, in my talk, in my ‘me’ which
        is thus transformed: or I have it not. When I grow too
        feeble to live in the present, then, perhaps, will I live
        in the past; but more likely will I take then the quick
        jump into the great future.”</p>

    <p>He was eager to go at his planning. The designs
        were talked over; sketches made, discarded and approved;
        the material tested and sorted, and the benches
        cleaned for action.</p>

    <p>For several days the “smitty” was too busy for
        talk, except such business-like conversation as was
        needed to push the work forward; all copper does not
        anneal with the same result, nor does all charcoal burn
        with the same intensity; but after the plate, candlestick,
        candelabrum or vase had begun to reach a half-recognizable
        shape, there would be a lull.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“How is that Neddie fellow?” Bardek inquired. “I
        don’t see him hanging about and making the smile of
        idleness. More ‘home-run,’ eh?”</p>

    <p>She explained that he was busy with his medical
        courses and, further, that Bea Wilcox had laid
        claims upon all his surplus time.</p>

    <p>“Now, that is so much better,” honest Bardek nodded
        approval. “He is nice boy; nice, clean boy. I like—when
        the day’s work is done—to take him on my
        knee and sing sweet, sleepy songs, <i>‘Schlaf’, Kindschen,
            schlaf’,’ und so weiter</i>.... But he smoke too many
        cigarette: so he will not grow.”</p>

    <p>“He is twenty-two, Bardek,” Gorgas rejoined, but
        not disclosing in her tone any defense of Morris.
        “That is five years older than I.”</p>

    <p>“You!” Bardek gazed at her. “Ha! You! Little
        Neddie will never be so old as Miss Gorgas. You
        take by years? Ah, that such wrong way to make
        measure. Today the whole world is one day older
        than yesterday, but is every man of the world just one
        day older? <i>Ach, gar nichts!</i> There are some who have
        lived—ah! how they have lived while the slow hours
        of last night moved away!—and there are some who
        have made one jump from child to man, and there are
        some baby-women who have in that little day turned to
        be mothers of babies, and there are some who have stood
        just where they are, and others who have gone back
        from jus’ fool to imbecile. The day, the month, the
        year, it is nothing. When I would know the age I do
        not look in the calendar—<i>ach, nein!</i>—I look in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
        eyes. Back of eyes, sprawling out nicely on soft, gray
        stuff, is <i>you</i>! Jus’ there!” he tapped his forehead.
        “In little children, I have seen, back there, wise old
        folks—you were jus’ such a little wise one when you
        first came to me. Your Neddie is jus’ boy—nice,
        clean, fresh boy. Oh, he will make nice man some day—if
        he grow up.”</p>

    <p>It was difficult to know when Bardek spoke out of his
        serious opinions or through a desire to stir up his listeners.
        In English, especially, was he hard to fathom.
        Sometimes his auditors had laughed at the wrong spot,
        had taken his most earnest talk as if intended for droll
        humor. It was not prudent so to do; for then Bardek
        called on his heavy artillery of irony and satire, and
        woe betide the weakling who stood before him: the personal
        blemish of his opponent, moral or physical, which
        society had agreed to ignore, was trotted out for inspection,
        caparisoned with many unique beauties of
        language. To Gorgas, Ned Morris had seemed quite
        a man; but she deferred questioning Bardek too closely
        on that point.</p>

    <p>Instead, she seemed to shift the subject.</p>

    <p>“I envy you your freedom, Bardek,” she sighed.
        “When you want a thing, you just go and take it. If
        you want to cut loose you can say, ‘Let her go, Gallagher’
        and boomp! you’re at the bottom. It takes
        courage, I tell you. One has to just stop caring for
        everybody and what everybody thinks. I can’t. I
        can’t be free. I’d like to break away and, if I wanted
        to, eat my breakfast in the middle of Main street—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
        my bare feet, too; but I couldn’t do it. Not that I
        care an awful lot about what folks say. It isn’t exactly
        that; but I’d be scared stiff. I might get as
        far as Main street with my oatmeal and roll, but my
        teeth would be chattering so much from fright that
        I couldn’t get the breakfast down.”</p>

    <p>Bardek thought the matter over carefully. Then he
        eyed her seriously and asked:</p>

    <p>“Something in your mind, it troubles you, eh?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no.”</p>

    <p>He was not convinced.</p>

    <p>“When you have great troubles, tell somebody.
        Confession is good. That what makes ol’ Mac such a
        fine man. He is always clean, is ol’ Mac. Every Saturday
        night he stand in line and think of the bad in
        him—it is not much, but no matter—then he soon
        be on his knees to tell the father and when he come out
        he is all w’ite-wash inside. Ol’ Mac, his mind is not
        always full of dead matters and ferments and things
        that go bad. His mind is like my house after Mrs.
        Mac have come to slop hot soap-water over everyt’ing.
        I know. Sometimes I, too, go to father and tell him
        everything.... No troubles, eh?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, nothing’s the matter with me, Bardek; that is,
        nothing worth telling.”</p>

    <p>“Very well,” he nodded. “When you make confession
        you must want to do it. Your inside will tell
        you it is time when.”</p>

    <p>“That’s just what I want to know, Bardek,” she
        brought him back. “You listen to what the ‘inside’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
        bids you do, and you never question what the ‘outside’
        would say. That’s freedom. I wish I had it.”</p>

    <p>He worked for some time at his designing, as if he
        did not care to discuss the matter further. Occasionally,
        he looked over his shoulder at her, staring into
        her eyes as if to see what was within.</p>

    <p>“So you would be free?” he asked quietly. “Well,
        it is easy. But first, you must know what freedom is—and
        that is hard. I have had many thoughts about
        freedom and have changed my mind many, many times;
        and just now I am not so sure as I was three, five, ten
        year ago. Once I t’ink freedom is ‘do as you please.’
        In America you say that so much, ‘I do as I please.’
        It is vairy nice. But ‘as I please’ is sometime not
        nice. For one, two, three minutes, yes. When you
        jump into nice, cold water and swim when it is yet
        April, ‘Oh!’ you say, ‘it is fine!’ but the next day
        you sneeze and for two weeks you have bad cold. That
        not vairy nice, eh? Now, I think you have not freedom
        then. You put great chains on you which keep you in
        house for two weeks when you would please go out.
        Sometimes it is freedom to be wise and not do ‘as I
        please.’</p>

    <p>“You t’ink to sit in Main street and eat breakfast
        is freedom. You are right, quite right, if that is what
        you do want. But also, you want peoples to like you
        and not to laugh and touch the head and say, ‘What
        a crazy, silly child!’ You must choose. Well, you
        find you didn’t want to sit in Main street; not at all.
        It give you just what you don’t want.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“Life is full of jus’ that. ‘To do as you please,’
        yes, that is to be free. But it is so hard to know what
        will please. You want swim in April spring water?
        You do not want cold in head? You cannot have both,
        my child. Freedom is to know what one to take. And
        who is to tell? It is hard, vairy hard.</p>

    <p>“Then there are the other peoples—the great
        crowd, of them I do not think much—but of vairy few,
        my wife and those big boys, and you, Miss Gorgas, and
        of ol’ Mac—well, of them I do care. To keep them
        happy I must not have somet’ings. I <i>please</i> not to
        have them. I want them vairy much—oh, vairy much
        I want them—but so do I want to see the good friends
        with smiling face. I have freedom—yes—but I lose
        much. And it is good to lose.”</p>

    <p>Gorgas was thinking how similar were the philosophies
        of Bardek and Allen Blynn, although each expressed
        his point of view in different ways. Here was
        an essential agreement on the mystic puzzle of human
        conduct, and by men who looked upon life from nearly
        opposite angles. It was as if Puritan and Cavalier,
        Stoic and Epicurean, Spartan and Athenian had for
        once settled their eternal quarrel.</p>

    <p>“How did you learn all this?” Gorgas asked.</p>

    <p>“By much troubles and much pains,” he shook his
        head. “You get one little cold in head. Ah! That
        is nothing. You learn so cheap! But I? I have
        walked in blood.... <i>Nom d’une pipe!</i> how I pay to
        know so little!”</p>

    <p>Whatever were the experiences that Bardek conjured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
        up, it prevented further speech. So they hammered
        away for the remainder of that morning without
        further discussion. Occasionally in the pauses she
        would hear Bardek muttering his <i>nom d’une pipe!</i>—a
        sign of great perturbation.</p>

    <p>And she was glad. Clearness had come into her
        thinking. In her mind now she was certain of the
        track for a little way ahead. She had asked about
        freedom because she meant to liberate herself from a
        great thralldom, but she had feared the consequences;
        now that she had been taught to face all the choices, all
        the possible results, she had chosen and was content.</p>

        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>

        <h3 class="nobreak">XXI<br>

            EVE’S CHOICE</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE Allen Blynn, packing up his belongings
        at the end of the term, was far
        from either decision or content. The faculty
        of Holden College had divided bitterly on the question
        of the introduction of “electives.” Nowadays electives
        are accepted so serenely that one forgets how sinful
        they were some twenty or more years ago; but we shall
        not here touch the terrible battle which waged over the
        contention of the conservatives that a college senior
        could not hope to be a gentleman unless he had read
        the “Pseudolus” of Maccius Plautus. It is enough
        to know that, led by the example of Eliot of Harvard,
        Blynn had joined the sinful radicals and was openly
        preaching the “new education.”</p>

    <p>This young man, who could be so eloquent with
        Gorgas Levering on the subject of Conservatism in
        Private Conduct, found himself an unwilling Public Reformer
        in Education. In his private thoughts he
        bound the law rigorously upon himself, but in public he
        was an impatient radical demanding that Holden College
        should cease weeping sentimentally over its eighteenth
        century past and begin to do its duty toward the
        children of the present year of grace. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
        know that that sort of inconsistency is alarmingly common.
        A man may be in favor of freedom as regards
        his country, but not as regards the goings and comings
        of his wife; a man may love his neighbor as himself on
        Sundays, yet unmercifully send promissory notes to
        protest on Mondays.</p>

    <p>Naturally the students were solid for the electives
        and against Maccius Plautus and all his tribe, and with
        bonfires and shoutings they lauded their spokesman on
        the faculty. But it was the newspapers that shot the
        controversy out of its local setting and made it semi-national
        and glaringly notorious. And it was not all
        due to the managing of Diccon. Some men are naturally
        dramatic; all that they do is already good “news”;
        and once in the headlines it is almost impossible to keep
        out. Let a lawyer win a scandalous case or a clergyman
        defy his bishop; for the remainder of his days he
        cannot so much as visit the zoological garden without
        having the matter publicly heralded. The papers gave
        space to the Holden reforms because Blynn was back
        of them. Blynn could be counted on for spectacular
        things. “The Lady of the Interruption” had made
        him a perpetual headliner!</p>

    <p>It was a heavy-hearted young man, therefore, who
        travelled toward Mount Airy the next morning, unable
        to escape some of the congratulations or to avoid seeing
        his picture flaring on the inside page of newspapers
        held by fellow passengers. He assumed the guilty
        skulk of an embezzling cashier, fearful lest he should
        find some casual eye comparing him with the photograph.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
        He wondered what dreadful things they had
        said about him, but dared not read. The newspaper
        “boys” liked him—all boys did; they showed their
        affection by writing him up as if he were a pedagogic
        Luther, and it made him almost ill. “Rumors” of the
        resignation of President Galt and the election of President
        Blynn had been heard by the astute scribe. Dear
        old Rumor, patron saint of reporters!</p>

    <p>Diccon did his share in the home town; he wrote
        beautiful imitation telegrams to his paper, briefly summing
        up the essential matter in dispute and making out
        a clear victory for their fellow-townsman, whose call to
        an important post in another city had been thus so
        thoroughly justified.</p>

    <p>Blynn protested, but Diccon claimed to be powerless.
        “You’re ‘news’ now, old man,” he explained.
        “Nothing on earth could keep you from publicity.
        When newspapers begin to give you four or five thousand
        dollars’ worth of free advertising, it is because
        they think it pays. Once they have made you famous—”</p>

    <p>“Infamous!” suggested Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Same thing”; Diccon was undisturbed; “they’d
        do the same by you if you scuttled a hospital and got
        off with the job. When they go in to make you known
        to thousands of readers they have created customers
        for that sort of news. Every time you’re mentioned
        after that, they are assured of satisfied nods from
        their patrons. You are a continued story, a never-ending
        serial.... And you can’t expect me to howl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
        can you? You have made good, as I knew you would.
        Well, that cleans my slate. No one can say I pulled
        for a friend. You happened to be my friend, but also
        you happened to be the best man for the job.”</p>

    <p>“Accident! accident!” cried Blynn; “accident and
        the absurdity of news values.”</p>

    <p>In that frame of mind he dropped in on the Leverings.
        Mrs. Levering and Kate were sewing on the
        lawn at the rear in the shade of their huge chestnut
        trees. Gorgas was in town purchasing materials for
        the “smitty.”</p>

    <p>The old familiarity was there in their greetings and
        something of warmth due to the natural joy in another’s
        success; but there was also a deferential treatment
        due to his newspaper fame, which made him uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>“My dear Professor Blynn,” Mrs. Levering beamed
        toward him, “I do wish I could get courage to ask you
        to glance over the literary program of our little club.
        We’re not at all satisfied with the plans for next year;
        of course, we are all amateurs without taste or knowledge.
        But I’m afraid you are so busy with—”</p>

    <p>“Not at all!” Blynn broke in. “Do let me work
        with you. I should be delighted. I have bushels of
        time and I’ll dig for you like a good gardener, provided—you
        don’t call me ‘professor.’”</p>

    <p>“Oh, you’re too modest.”</p>

    <p>“Not at all; I’m too proud!” he laughed. “In
        America ‘professor’ and ‘doctor’ are the inferior
        titles; ‘Mr.’ is really the mark of distinction. I like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
        the way they say ‘Mr.’ Eliot in Cambridge. Fancy
        saying ‘Professor’ Eliot or even ‘Dr.’ Eliot! It
        would be like referring to Dr. George Washington!
        And he was an LL. D., too; both Harvard and U. of P.;
        but who remembers that? I have been ‘professored’
        all my life. You don’t know how I yearn—like a
        small boy—to be called ‘Mr.’”</p>

    <p>“Mr.” was agreed upon by Mrs. Levering, although
        Kate demurred.</p>

    <p>“We always call you ‘Allen Blynn’ when we talk
        of you here at home,” she remarked thoughtfully. “I
        always say ‘Allen.’ You call me Kate; perhaps I had
        better dub you—”</p>

    <p>“‘Pete’—for Petruchio,” he joked. “You can’t
        tell, you know. Fine weather like this, the germ is
        everywhere.” He was reminding her of his theory that
        love was a contagion.</p>

    <p>“I fear you are immune,” she looked up from her
        embroidery frame and searched his face comically.</p>

    <p>His eyes had the far-off stare of men who dream
        much. Your thinker is no great lover, she thought.
        He is too busy with the affections of his brain, the
        little loves of his own creation; even in their most animated
        conversations they seem only to half attend to
        what is going on about them.</p>

    <p>“Please don’t say that,” Blynn protested. “Why,
        vaccination takes on me terribly. I am awfully susceptible.
        You don’t know how I want to be—uh—quarantined
        and posted as a dangerous case.”</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering arose. “Of all nasty talk!” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
        smiled. “Germs and disease! I fear I don’t quite
        follow you two young persons. And, besides, there
        is a garden in the back of the house that demands my
        inspection. Ugh! How can you laugh in the same
        breath with germs!” She moved off toward her garden.</p>

    <p>“Where’s the child?” Blynn looked toward the
        “smitty.”</p>

    <p>“What child?” Kate followed his gaze. “Oh, Gorgas?
        Child! You haven’t seen her since spring, have
        you? That child is sprouting, I tell you. She’s taller
        than I, by an inch or two. And her gowns! She’s been
        spreading herself lately! Gracious! You won’t dare
        to call her child—”</p>

    <p>“Why, she’s only seventeen!”</p>

    <p>“In years, yes; but in experience and general get-up
        she is twenty-five. Really, she’s quite stunning. It’s
        made me spruce up, I can tell you.... But, I’m not
        sorry, you know.... I say, I’m not sorry.”</p>

    <p>“Why?” coming back abruptly to the lady before
        him.</p>

    <p>“If Bianca has enough swains Katherina may have
        a chance with the left-overs.”</p>

    <p>“Do you recall the advice I gave you the last time
        we were talking on this subject!” Blynn leaned forward
        and grew earnest.</p>

    <p>She nodded and exhibited her embroidery.</p>

    <p>“This is all I’m fit for.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t say that. It isn’t fair to yourself, and it
        isn’t true. I wish you would let me take you in hand.
        I have had boys who have felt just as you do, until I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
        enticed them really to get started at something.”</p>

    <p>She agreed that it sounded exciting, but Petruchio
        might come along; one was never without hope; and
        then, smash! would go all the toil.</p>

    <p>He pondered over that, and questioned why a woman’s
        occupation should go smash! just because she married.</p>

    <p>“Women don’t want any other occupation,” she
        confessed. “I don’t.”</p>

    <p>“I bet a dollar it’s pure use and wont!” he exclaimed.
        “Nobody can tell what is just custom and
        what is not, until after we’re dead a thousand years.
        Women don’t throw themselves into careers with the
        same daring energy as men, because they have to keep
        such a terrible look-out for marriage. At any moment,
        from around the corner, as you once said, their future
        may assail them. It’s almost as if a young man got up
        in the morning a barrel-maker and by night found himself
        a deep-sea diver! That’s disconcerting. I should
        think the excitement of guessing what might happen
        would play havoc with that cooperage business.”</p>

    <p>They speculated on the uncertainty of a girl’s life;
        uncertain until some man decided for her.</p>

    <p>“You see,” Kate explained. “A boy has his fortune
        to make and knows it depends upon a lot of acquired
        qualities; and unless he’s exceptional he can
        predict pretty well what that fortune is going to be.
        All that he has to do is to look at his father. Now a
        girl, no matter what her father or mother may be, has
        every chance in the world. A prince might choose her—haven’t
        royal dukes married chorus girls?—or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
        grocer’s apprentice, or the next governor of the State,
        or—the head of the division of English.”</p>

    <p>He acknowledged the point, but his mind was concentrated
        on something else.</p>

    <p>“And nobody may choose her at all,” he added significantly.</p>

    <p>“But she won’t know that till she’s dead,” Kate responded
        gaily. “And not even then, perhaps—‘There
        is hope beyond the grave,’ you know!”</p>

    <p>“There’s my point,” he stuck out an argumentative
        finger, his earnest eye quite showing that he had missed
        her light pleasantry. “She ought to know it long
        before. She ought to face the fact of the million or
        so of unmarried women—good, fine women, too. She
        ought to presume from the very beginning—her mother
        should put it into her head—that in all probability she
        will not marry. The dreams should be deliberately
        shaken out of her; the years of pretty primping and
        ogling I would abolish without a qualm. The women
        on parade! Ugh! I fly from them and find shelter
        with the aged married ones.</p>

    <p>“Now you,” he turned to her with such frankness
        as quite to disarm the direct speech. “You live in a
        village, revolving in an eddy; it would be a sheer accident
        if your mate found you.”</p>

    <p>“I might take Eve’s choice,” she reflected. How
        amused she seemed!</p>

    <p>“What was that?” he interrupted his argument.
        The phrase was new to him.</p>

    <p>“The only man available.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Ah! Eve’s choice! The only man available and
        the man God created for her. That’s a wonderful
        choice and a rare combination in history, you must
        admit.”</p>

    <p>No; she must face the facts. She was a member of
        the most unmarriageable class of women, those who
        are neither rich nor poor, yet who sit at home unknown.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering could be seen occasionally hovering
        over her garden. Once or twice she stood erect, her
        ample figure surrounded by all the flowers of June, and
        surveyed with satisfaction the two earnest young persons.
        A few more such <i>tête-à-têtes</i>, that was all. Let
        them be together. Somehow, she felt that she had managed
        things excellently. Some persons would take
        credit for the laws of nature. If the sun should shine
        brightly on her lawn party she would accept congratulations
        as if it were a right tribute to her cleverness.</p>

    <p>“You’ll do, Allen Blynn,” Mrs. Levering remarked
        to a drooping rose-bud. Allen was talking earnestly
        with head and hands. Kate seemed to be looking absently
        away. “But Keyser Levering will have to be
        spoken to,” she added. “I’m afraid she is too cold.”</p>

    <p>Then she ordered Louisa to prepare a platter of
        sweet cakes and an iced lemon drink, carefully concocted
        to suit the warm weather.</p>

    <p>She might have recalled the order if she had known
        at that moment Allen Blynn was proving to Keyser
        Levering that as marrying for her was probably out of
        the question it behooved her instantly to find a sensible
        life-job!</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>And she found it. By accident the work that she
        was destined to do unfolded to her. And by the same
        accident Allen Blynn found his own work.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap2">AS Mrs. Levering, flanked by Louisa and the
        refreshments, moved toward them, Kate
        shifted the subject.</p>

    <p>“Did you know I have been coaching the Croft
        boy?”</p>

    <p>“No!” he was surprised. “He hasn’t said anything
        to me about it. Since when?”</p>

    <p>“Practically all winter.”</p>

    <p>“Well! well!” he ejaculated. “I thought that chap
        was coming up strong. You quite take the wind out
        of my sails. I had been giving myself all sorts of
        kudos over that case. And here it’s you, all the time.
        How did it happen?”</p>

    <p>“He brought me over one of your letters,” she explained
        as she helped with sugar. “Your stenographer
        by-the-hour had mixed up an important direction.
        He disliked to ask you about it—you know how shy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
        he is—so he put it to me. I puzzled it out; we became
        very well acquainted and began to hold regular
        irregular sessions together.... I enjoyed your letters
        immensely. Once, you took him to task about a
        stupid error which was really mine. He had a good
        laugh at me, I can tell you. Isn’t he a pathetic little
        fellow?”</p>

    <p>“He’ll be a great thinker some day,” Blynn avowed.
        “You’ll be proud of your share in the making of
        him.”</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering was pleased to hear them discussing
        methods of pedagogy so intimately.</p>

    <p>“You’ll have Keyser turning school-mistress, yet,”
        she suggested. But her smile showed that she had no
        such fear.</p>

    <p>“And why not!” Blynn seized the idea. “Oh, I
        don’t mean the regular kind; normal training, public
        school and all that sort of thing. That’s fine, too; but
        it’s overcrowded with women, and the whole business
        is set like a plaster cast. I almost despair of seeing
        any development there; routine and habit have fastened
        themselves upon the institution. I have dreams
        of another kind of teacher, something like Pestalozzi,
        gathering his little ones about him and teaching them
        without ever their being aware.”</p>

    <p>He told them about Pestalozzi. When the scourge
        of war swept over Switzerland in 1798 neither men nor
        women were spared. It was a massacre. Pestalozzi’s
        heart went out to the children. In a ruined convent
        on the shores of Lake Lucerne, he gathered the deserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
        little ones about him and shared their sufferings.
        They had neither home nor parents, and they
        were hungry. “I cannot fight,” he said; “I cannot
        raise my hand against my brother; but the children of
        my brother, the fatherless children, these I can serve,
        their piteous little bodies I can save, and their starving
        desolate souls.” Blynn darted into the library and
        brought out a book and read them Pestalozzi’s own
        story. “‘My hand lay in their hand, my eye was their
        eye, my tears flowed with their tears, and my laughter
        mingled with their laughter. They were out of the
        raging world; they were with me, and I was with them.
        Their meat was mine, their drink was mine. I had
        nothing, no friends, no servants; I had them alone.
        When they were well I stood in their midst; when they
        were ill I was at their side. I was the last who went
        to bed at night, the first who rose in the morning.
        Even in bed I prayed and talked with them until they
        were asleep,—they wished it to be so.’”</p>

    <p>Blynn closed the book reverently. “They say he
        was an unhandsome man, but that he had a wonderful
        transforming smile. He saw into the heart of children.
        I should be happy if I were that sort.</p>

    <p>“My dream is to have just such a school,” Blynn
        continued. “I have even gone as far as to pick out
        the site—off in Cresheim Valley. We should have to
        select our teachers with the utmost care. They must
        be gifted to communicate freely with children. Communication
        is everything. I don’t care much about
        what they know, although we must have skill there, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
        especially in art work and languages; but the main
        thing in teaching is not knowledge, but wisdom.”</p>

    <p>Mrs. Levering voiced the discontent of parents with
        schools as they are and expressed the belief that there
        would be no difficulty in securing paying pupils.</p>

    <p>“It would be a great joy to spend one’s life at that
        task,” he mused.</p>

    <p>“Why don’t you?” Kate inquired quietly.</p>

    <p>Well, he was a professor of English; that was the
        first reason. His studies had all been to prepare him
        for scholarship. One could not go against one’s life
        preparation. The main reason seemed to be the matter
        of expense. Elisha might begin such an undertaking,
        but not without the ravens. It costs money even
        to do good. To open such a school and keep it going
        would require a never-ending store of health and good
        cheer. The vitality of the staff would be absolutely
        essential to its life. Worry over money or, worse, the
        necessity of putting good energy into outside work—that
        would wear down the most courageous spirit and
        would mean slow failure.</p>

    <p>But his mind was on the theme. He sketched the
        ideal environment for children as he saw it clear before
        him. There should be much out-of-doors, and glorious
        muscle-stretching play; health should come first, and
        then the searching discovery of individual aptitude.
        The world’s store of necessary information would be
        transferred as naturally and as imperceptibly as
        growth. The children would never once object; the
        enormous turbines of curiosity would actually drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
        them along; give a child half a chance and he will
        question himself into intelligence.</p>

    <p>And what a pace these youngsters would travel! He
        had one boy—one of his “cases” whom he taught
        personally and by correspondence—who had done
        four years of grammar school work in eight months.</p>

    <p>“He was not forced,” Blynn explained; “he was
        enticed to discover his speed. We dawdle mightily
        in our long years of preparation. Think of deciding
        before you were born that you must not study fractions
        until you are eleven years of age! You should see
        some of my six-year-old lads eat up fractions! They
        love ’em! Especially the vulgar and the improper
        ones!”</p>

    <p>“Allen Blynn,” Kate remarked, “with all your gift
        for discovering the genius of others, you haven’t found
        out your own ability.”</p>

    <p>“And what is that, pray?”</p>

    <p>“At heart you’re not really a college professor—”</p>

    <p>“I believe you,” earnestly. “I’m afraid I ‘profess’
        for a livelihood and for the excitement that’s in it.
        The racket I’ve stirred up in Holden; phew! But what
        can I do?” he spread out his hands pathetically. “I
        am ‘professing’ because scholarship is not endowed.
        Scholarship and teaching! They are the antipodes!
        Scratch a fine scholar and you’ll probably find a
        wretched teacher.”</p>

    <p>“I doubt if you are even a scholar,” she persisted.</p>

    <p>“Please be more careful, Keyser,” Mrs. Levering
        looked up from her sewing. “You mustn’t be flippant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
        you know. That’s <i>one</i> of the things the Leverings do
        not do, whatever else they may be guilty of.”</p>

    <p>“I’m very much in earnest, mother,” Kate continued.
        “Allen Blynn is a genius with little children. He
        should be a primary teacher, that’s—”</p>

    <p>“Gracious!” Mrs. Levering stared. “Why not
        hire him as a coachman or gardener! Primary teacher!
        That’s a sort of public nursery governess, isn’t it?”</p>

    <p>Blynn was regarding Kate in deep perplexity.</p>

    <p>“Remember Pestalozzi,” she ignored her mother.
        “You have just his spirit and just his gift. You have
        something of his face, too. Oh, I know they say he was
        a plain man, but they called Lincoln that. Few people
        understand the beauty of ruggedness—”</p>

    <p>“Thanks,” he bowed.</p>

    <p>“Children always understand. And they thoroughly
        comprehend you, Allen Blynn. I have watched you at
        your work. It’s—it’s just great! That’s <i>your</i> job,
        sir!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I hope you’re right,” he glowed innocently.
        “Wouldn’t it be fine! You could help— There!
        That’s your job, madam!”</p>

    <p>“And Gorgas could do the shop end—” Kate put
        in enthusiastically.</p>

    <p>“And Bardek!” remembered Allen. “Wouldn’t he
        be a cracker-jack at the languages!—”</p>

    <p>“And Mac,” remarked Mrs. Levering satirically.
        “He could teach horsemanship and stabling.”</p>

    <p>“Why not!” exclaimed both Kate and Allen. “Mac
        cares for horses the way everybody should care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
        for children,” said one. “He’s the sort of teacher I
        should want for myself,” said the other.</p>

    <p>And so they chattered until Allen remembered that
        the lack of funds stood forever in the way.</p>

    <p>“But I couldn’t finance it,” he concluded gloomily.
        “I’m no good at the money business. If a man owed
        me fifty dollars—there are several who do!—I’d
        never get it unless he volunteered to pay. That’s the
        reason I enjoy my ‘cases’ so much. If anyone forced
        me to accept money I would decamp. I have no financial
        ability.”</p>

    <p>“Neither had Pestalozzi,” Kate reminded him.</p>

    <p>“To be sure he hadn’t,” he mused. “But that’s
        why he failed.”</p>

    <p>“But he didn’t have a manager.”</p>

    <p>“Neither have I.”</p>

    <p>“Let me take the post?”</p>

    <p>For the first time Mrs. Levering saw some sense in
        their talk. A secret admiration for the daughter’s
        astuteness almost showed in her face.</p>

    <p>“Just you let Keyser manage for you, Mr. Blynn,”
        the mother nodded her head significantly. “She runs
        this house—and everybody in it. When it comes to
        money Keyser can do wonders on nothing.”</p>

    <p>“I can believe it,” laughed Blynn. “Pennsylvania-German
        thrift is notorious. But how could you ‘manage’?
        We haven’t a red cent.”</p>

    <p>“Let us see,” Kate searched among her sewing things
        for paper and pencil. “What is your income outside
        of your salary at Holden?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“How <i>can</i> you be so impertinent?” the mother interfered.
    </p>

    <p>“Oh, no,” Blynn urged. “This is not impertinent,
        it’s important. She should ask that first. It will bring
        the school of cards down at the first shot. Outside
        of salary and lectures and writings, my sure income is
        exactly $96 per annum, the rental of Bardek’s house.
        I have a half-dozen other small properties. Sometimes
        I have had as much as $600 a year. It practically
        put me through college. Of course, mother has her
        own. Just at present I am pulling about $300. The
        reason I know is that I have just had an annual report
        from the agent. But Bardek is the only sure tenant.
        The dream’s up, my lady; oats is too high.”</p>

    <p>“Do you think so?” she was calmly figuring.
        “Please let me do the managering, if I am to be manager.”
        After a moment or two of consideration she
        looked up satisfied. But first she asked questions.
        They included a complete list of his “cases.” Alongside
        of each one she checked those who could pay and
        those who could not.</p>

    <p>“Here’s my scheme,” she showed him her paper.
        “I’ll rent you five acres of woodland for the grounds.
        There’s a good stone house there. It needs fixing up.
        I’ll attend to that. It’s just off the old mill above
        Cresheim Creek, where the road forks and goes up, you
        know, at the top of the hill.”</p>

    <p>“‘Top-o’-the-Hill!’” he exclaimed. “We’ll call it
        ‘Top-o’-the-Hill.’ But,” ruefully, “where are we going
        to get the rent?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“On the premises,” she continued. “I shall retain
        51% of the stock and demand one wild rose paid to
        me every year with proper literary ceremonies.”</p>

    <p>“A Pageant of the Wild Rose,” said he. “We
        shall crown you queen and I will recite. Listen!
        Wouldn’t this be nice and lugubrious. It’s old Dick
        Fanshawe’s fancy of complimenting his lady-love three
        hundred years ago.”</p>

    <p>He began with, “Blown in the morning, thou shalt
        fade ere noon”—but she interrupted at the first
        line.</p>

    <p>“I should particularly fancy that when I am growing
        aged and the petals begin to drop off. But to
        come down to business,” the manager referred to her
        paper; “would keeping up your outside lectures be too
        much for you?”</p>

    <p>“Not at all,” he rejoined. “That is mere play. I
        figured out once that I could just about make a living
        by giving one or two series each year.”</p>

    <p>“Well, then, that’s disposed of,” she resumed. “We
        could charge $100 a year to each pupil I have checked
        on this list, and let the others come in free. Bardek
        and Gorgas and I would serve without pay. I don’t
        need it and the other two are making lots of money.
        They really ought to contribute something. We can
        guarantee you, with your lectures and your rentals,”
        she verified carefully the totals in her memoranda,
        “two thousand a year at the least, which ought to be
        enough. When we can afford it we’ll take all your
        time. And we’ll see about those houses of yours, too;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
        just put them in my hands and I’ll boost your cash
        account, I have some of that same sort of property
        myself and you bet your buttons I don’t let any agent
        monkey with them.”</p>

    <p>Gorgas bounded in with a roseate greeting, and
        after her gown had been admired the project was gone
        over again.</p>

    <p>“I’d love it,” she chirped. “Let me pay all the
        bills. I’ve got loads of money.”</p>

    <p>They talked of the business and of the proposal for
        awhile and then drifted into an animated discussion of
        methods. The children must spend the whole day
        with them. There would be a fine midday dinner, a
        powerful educational instrument. They would teach
        the three r’s and all the informational necessities, but
        they would also cultivate the graces of cheerfulness, unselfishness,
        fair play, courage, restraint and table manners.
        There should be no scoldings and no punishments;
        and while they might talk and sing and even
        dance in languages, there should be no conjugations!
        And there would be tree climbing, and sledding, baseball
        and tennis and swimming and skating and riding,
        and dancing, all a part of the course of study. They
        even got so far as outlining a prospectus and selecting
        a name. Of a host of suggestions, “Top-o’-the-Hill”
        remained first choice.</p>

    <p>“It is from the top of that hill,” said Blynn, “that
        I always see Whittier’s ‘dun files of Krisheim’s home-bound
        cows’ and hear them clanking their bells up the
        rough road. Do you know, milady,” he turned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
        Kate, “that John Greenleaf Whittier wrote a considerable
        poem on our little Valley?”</p>

    <p>“Did he?” she asked, with a smiling lack of interest.
        “I am not very poetic, you know—just a practical
        person who owns some earth, the very spot for
        your school.”</p>

    <p>A messenger-boy bicycled slowly along the road,
        peering here and there at houses on either side. He
        stopped to inquire at the Williams’ and came back to
        the Levering gate. Mrs. Levering walked forward.
        Gorgas, Kate, and Allen were lost in their discussion.</p>

    <p>“It’s a telegram for you, Mr. Blynn,” Mrs. Levering
        handed him the envelope. “Your mother sent him
        over here. It is prepaid. I have signed for you.”</p>

    <p>His face, after he had read the paper carefully, gave
        the three women a fright, but he hastened to reassure
        them.</p>

    <p>“Perhaps it is good news,” he said; “I don’t know.
        It really frightens me.” He searched their faces hesitantly,
        then decided. “I am told to keep this information
        strictly to myself, but I’m sure it will not do
        harm to tell you, especially Gorgas and Kate, after all
        your beautiful plans. I’m afraid they’re knocked sky-high.
        It is from Diccon. He is at Holden now attending
        a special meeting of the trustees. Oh, it’s
        really dreadful.”</p>

    <p>He read:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“Strictly private information not yet made public.
            President Galt will resign to take effect next term. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
            goes on retirement at full salary. Trustees to engineer
            a monster farewell dinner of alumni. He goes out
            covered with laurels. Says he recognizes time to make
            a climax of his life-work and will leave the working out

        <p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Diccon.</span>”</p>
    </div>

    <p>“How perfectly splendid!” exclaimed Mrs. Levering.</p>

    <p>The other members of the group looked like a trio
        of sentenced convicts.</p>

    <p>“How can you say that, mother!” Kate spoke
        sharply. “Everything was so lovely—and now
        there’ll be no Top-o’-the-Hill.”</p>

    <p>“It’s beastly,” snapped Gorgas. “I hate Holden;
        always did. Squabbling, little, petty kid-factory.”</p>

    <p>“It’s awful!” murmured the candidate of a majority
        of the trustees.</p>

    <p>But eventually they talked off their disappointment
        and began to see things from a less personal point of
        view. Blynn showed them the absurdity of his own
        qualifications; there were other men in the faculty to
        whom the elevation would be not only welcome but deserving.</p>

    <p>“I am an accident,” he went on. “I got into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
        limelight. I took other men’s ideas and had the spokesman
        rôle. Everybody understood; I made no secret of
        it. Some folks can talk and others can’t. That’s all
        there is to it.... I suppose I’m a dramatic sort of
        chap. Diccon says I am. I get heated up with enthusiasm,
        the preacher in me comes to the front, and I
        splutter figures of speech.... In my lectures it comes
        out, and when I get the most applause,” he bowed his
        head, “I am the most ashamed. I like to thrill ’em,
        work the stops, soft pedal, <i>vox humana</i> and all that.
        I don’t mean to play on their feelings. I am honest
        with my own feelings but—there’s the trouble!—I do
        have feelings; and I show ’em.</p>

    <p>“It’s my running tongue that got me in this fix.
        Why does everybody put such foolish value on the
        talker! Talkers ought to be suppressed!”</p>

    <p>Gorgas came to her senses first.</p>

    <p>“I’m over my mad now,” she said. “Of course,
        you’ve got to go, whether you want to or not. They
        call it duty, I believe. That means something disagreeable
        that your insides won’t let you shirk. You can’t
        back out, Allen Blynn. I advised you to go to Holden.
        In fact, I had just this thing in mind. I wanted you
        to be big and famous and talked about. Well, you
        are. I’m not happy about it. This splendid idea of
        a school in Cresheim Valley where we could all work together
        and be somebodies ourselves—it’s an awful
        come-down to have to chuck it—”</p>

    <p>“Gorgas!” mildly from Mrs. Levering. “That talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
        doesn’t go at all with your lady-like clothes. I wish
        you wouldn’t say ‘chuck it.’”</p>

    <p>“Mother, I’m almost tempted to say ‘Rats!’”</p>

    <p>“Horrors!” the mother flung up her hands. “Say
        ‘chuck it’ if you must. That other word is positively
        vulgar. I can’t see why so many nice young
        boys and girls use such slang. Slang of the right sort,
        Mr. Blynn, I don’t mind; but the latest corruptions of
        the language are just low. Don’t toss those gloves on
        the ground, Gorgas, even if you do pay for them yourself.
        You have no proper reverence for fine clothes.”</p>

    <p>“I’m ready to swear, mother, at any moment. Look
        out!” Gorgas smiled grimly.</p>

    <p>“<i>Ein tousand ein hundred ein und zwanzig!</i>” helped
        Blynn. He was beginning to recover from the shock.</p>

    <p>“<i>Name of the name of a pipe!</i>” she added, and suggested,
        “Let’s talk it over with Bardek.”</p>

    <p>“Good!” everyone agreed, and they were off to the
        white cottage.</p>

    <p>Bardek was riding both children on his back, a
        French lancer charging flying Germans. The air was
        full of rippling French, fierce manifestations of ancient
        hatred. The children were echoing every annihilating
        threat.</p>

    <p>“You see at once a lesson in patriotism and savagery
        and the French language,” he explained after he
        had dismissed the cavalry. “The professor has come
        back. Good!” He shook hands effusively. “Do
        not be afraid. I will not kiss you. See! I hold myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
        back. It is for me a lesson in courage; I subdue
        the flesh.” He beat his breast like St. Jerome. “Sit,
        children,” he pointed to the collection of large flat-topped
        rocks which flanked his door.</p>

    <p>They talked all together and told him of “Top-o’-the-Hill”
        and the imminent presidency of Holden. The
        latter topic did not reach Bardek at all.</p>

    <p>“That Top-o’-the-Hill,”—he called it “Tope-o-t’-Heel”—“it
        is grand! I would like that—oh, so
        much. The ‘smithy’ it is good—it keep me alive and
        it make me forget—but to teach the little children, zat,
        my friends,” tears came to his eyes and his English went
        to pieces, “is what I—it is what—in English I cannot,”
        he blurted in torrential French. “That is what
        I am, teacher of children. In École Nouvelle at
        Grenoble I taught the little ones the languages! I can
        do that; ah, how well I can do that!—<i>I have the certificate
            of the University of Naples!</i>” he roared, and
        struck an attitude. “<i>And I am bachelier ès lettres de
            l’Université de Bordeaux!</i>”</p>

    <p>The group was tremendously impressed. They told
        him so noisily, and soothed his pride.</p>

    <p>“But in my silliness,” he slipped into his normal
        self, “I fight the big Austrian and then I must go away.
        This I should not tell you, but—it is told.”</p>

    <p>It was hard to break his enthusiasm. Little by little
        it came to him that Top-o’-the-Hill was a dream.
        He held himself in with great restraint while Holden and
        its presidency was put before him.</p>

    <p>“You should go, my friend,” he advised quietly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
        “It is a great honor—to be president of a big university
        and you so young. These other little schools
        for little fellows, they can be made by anybody; but
        the university, it is vairy important. When the time
        comes to succeed, one must not go back of the gods
        who send things. I have always had my will; I have
        laughed at fortune and I have been happy. But I
        know what it is to have the great thought in the brain
        to go up, up, up and be a man famous. They tell
        me you have that already. They talk about you out
        in the great world there,” he seemed deeply thoughtful
        over such honors. “And it is right. You are
        good. And you should not turn away from the big
        world and be like ol’ Bardek, who has nothings but for
        you kind friends. It is not always happy to be exile
        and live like pig.... So we must not have the little
        school at the top o’ the hill? It is a great pity—for
        me, and for the little fellows. <i>Nom d’une pipe!</i>” he
        grew more and more agitated. “What a thing to
        choose between, honors and presidents—and the little
        fellows. Oh, it is nice to have your name in beeg
        preent and to have all the little men bow and look up
        at you—but <i>nom du nom d’une pipe!</i>” His agitation
        increased. “It would not do to make Bardek
        to choose. I would put in one hand all the great nothings
        of the universities and poof!” he blew savagely.
        “It is wort’ one good laugh—jus’ that.... But,”
        he recovered himself, “men are not the same. And it
        is good. A world full of Bardeks! Hoi, yoi! It
        would be the ol’ devil who would have to laugh....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
        I do not want to discourage you, my friend. Go to
        your little place. The world will call it with big
        name. Maybe you, after while, will believe it, too.
        That is the way wit’ man. Go on! Be busy all day
        at typewriter. Run! Hurry!... Smile and laugh
        when you would better cry! Go up! Be success!
        But I am so sorry that we not have zat Tope-o’-t’-Heel.
        <i>Nom d’une pipe!</i>”
    </p>

    <p>Bardek turned abruptly and marched like a corporal
        of the guard straight into his white cottage.
        Kate stepped on ahead down the path and disappeared
        within the house. Gorgas pumped Allen’s hand at
        parting as if to assure him that although convicted and
        sentenced she would stand by him no matter what public
        opinion said.</p>

    <p>“This spoils something else for me,” she said. “I
        can’t talk about it now. Don’t ask. When do you go
        up to Holden?”</p>

    <p>“Tonight, I fear,” he confessed guiltily.</p>

    <p>“You will write to me?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I shall be gone for only a day or two, a week
        at the most. But I’ll write anyway,” he read her face,
        “though you may have to be satisfied with a dictated
        family letter.”</p>

    <p>“That’s better than silence.”</p>

    <p>He could think of nothing to say, he the much heralded
        talker! Her rather heavy voice had given an
        intonation to the sentence which seemed to hold it in the
        air. “That’s better than silence.”</p>

    <p>“It sounds like the ending of Hamlet,” he managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
        to be gay. “‘The rest is silence,’ you know. Goodby,
        child.”</p>

    <p>“Aufwiederhören, mein guter Kamarade.”</p>

    <p>“Aufwiederhören?” he repeated. “You shall hear
        from me if I have to send couriers!”</p>

            MY LORD AND EKE MY MASTER</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">BUT Gorgas did not hear from Allen Blynn, nor
        did he send couriers. For nearly a week he
        permitted himself to be led about by Diccon in
        the rôle of a “candidate,” growing each day more rebellious,
        and finally he had decamped. There was one
        important luncheon “to meet Professor Allen Blynn”
        which had to get along without its chief guest. The
        professor had seized his grip and fled. Rumor had it
        that he had buried himself in the University library,
        but Gorgas soon discovered that he had been seen under
        his own shade trees with his young pupils; and there
        she found him.</p>

    <p>He looked older, she noted as she peered cautiously
        at him through a hedge. And what was that on the
        end of his chin which waggled as he talked? Mercy!
        It was the beginnings of a beard! That tuft was certainly
        the sign of a man absorbed in his affairs or worried
        beyond peradventure.</p>

    <p>For some time she watched him through the hedge—“Getting
        used to the chin-thing,” she told him later.
        Howard Croft, the cripple boy, was reading aloud from
        a portentous history of philosophy; the two seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
        be stopping at every sentence to talk it out. She had
        rarely seen Allen Blynn so terribly in earnest.</p>

    <p>When she finally stepped through the hedge and came
        up to the studious pair, Allen gave her a nod, as much
        as to say, “Sit down and pretend to be busy or you’ll
        frighten this shy bird off.”</p>

    <p>For an hour she sketched beards of all nations, from
        Belshazzarian curls to the latest French twist, adroitly
        arranging it so that the boy could not see her.</p>

    <p>“You like to make folks suffer, Allen Blynn,” Gorgas
        scolded gently after the boy had gone. “How
        do you suppose the Leverings have stood all this waiting
        for you to come over and tell us the latest? I
        just couldn’t stand it any longer. If I don’t hear all
        about Holden and other things I’ll blow up. I’m to
        take you back with me for dinner. The old crowd—some
        of them—are to drop in. Oh, the papers have
        told everything, so you needn’t fear.”</p>

    <p>And all the time her mirthful eyes were fastened on
        his chin.</p>

    <p>“I cannot talk about it,” his lips closed firmly.
        “It makes me ill even to think of it. That’s why I
        have been working on the youngsters so solidly. It’s
        the only antidote.”</p>

    <p>She broke into sudden laughter. “It waggles when
        you talk.” She imitated by thrusting her own chin
        up and down grotesquely. “Why—oh, why did you
        do it?”</p>

    <p>“Oh!” he came out of his perplexity. “My Van
        Dyke? A barber persuaded me. My chin is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
        bristles, and it was too sensitive for shaving. He fixed
        it this way, and I have forgotten to remove it.”</p>

    <p>“I thought maybe it was penance for sins,” she
        choked back her laughter.</p>

    <p>“Don’t you like it?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” she steadied herself. “I like—anything
        that’s funny!... Wait.... I thought I was used
        to it, but I see it’ll take some time.... There! I’ll
        be good and won’t laugh at the big man. Come!” she
        tapped him cheerfully on the arm. “Come along with
        me. We’ve wasted loads of time already.... And
        trust that crowd for making you forget. When they
        see that—whisker! oh!” she held her handkerchief
        to her mouth. “You are <i>too</i> funny, Allen Blynn!
        They’ll want you to talk all night—to see—it go up
        and down!”</p>

    <p>As they walked along the shaded streets, she ceased
        joking him, except for an occasional mischievous peer
        around at the tufted chin. His good humor was equal
        to hers; but they soon settled into a more serious chat.</p>

    <p>The dinner had some of its old-time gaiety and irresponsibility.
        Morris and Bea Wilcox were at the
        announcement stage and therefore open to persistent
        raillery. Diccon was there to keep the topic away from
        Holden, and Betty and Mary had brought their young
        husbands. Far in the background, seated like an accustomed
        idol, Leopold smiled wisely over the whole.</p>

    <p>One may be sure that Blynn’s beard was greeted
        with excess of emotion. Beards were a rarity then;
        they were restricted by tacit law to dentists, young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
        physicians, returning European tourists, and war veterans.</p>

    <p>Almost the only difference between these dinner-parties
        and the others of five years ago was that they
        broke up earlier. There were trains to catch; there
        was the next day’s work; and in some cases there had
        begun to be babies to go back to. By ten o’clock Allen
        Blynn was alone with the Leverings.</p>

    <p>Everyone had avoided the topic of Holden with obvious
        premeditation. Diccon had passed the word
        along to “drop it,” but in the more intimate situation
        with the Leverings questions were bound to arise.</p>

    <p>“Diccon will have to do without me,” Allen spoke
        up with sudden firmness. “I am a candidate, I suppose;
        but I refuse to campaign.”</p>

    <p>Diccon had managed things with distressing brilliancy.
        Doubting members of the trustees had to be
        dined and talked into reason. And they had to be paid.</p>

    <p>“Paid?” Kate and Gorgas asked together. Mrs.
        Levering had elected to keep out of the conversation;
        her instinctive interest was to pilot the boat, not to
        take part in the ship’s concert.</p>

    <p>“Yes, paid,” nodded Blynn grimly. “Paid in
        blood.”</p>

    <p>“Oh,” the girls gasped in relief. Blood was permitted;
        money, never.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” he explained; “I had to entertain, tell
        sprightly stories, plunge into theories of education, and
        act all the while with sweeping smile and glittering
        eye—and voluble! as Tutivillus himself. And not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
        just to one person or to one group of persons, mind
        you; but to every Tom, Dick and Harry whom Diccon
        sicked on me. If they had come in battalions I could
        have done it, but they came in single file. When Diccon
        finally started to use me, we had dinners every night
        and luncheons every day, except one day, when we had
        two luncheons. Diccon said there was no other way
        out of it.”</p>

    <p>“I wouldn’t have done that for a peck of presidents,”
        said Gorgas firmly. “I’d have been myself.”</p>

    <p>“Myself!” echoed Allen. “Bless my soul! Myself
        during that whole trip was a silent, sullen, nasty-tongued
        person. If I had ever let myself out of the
        box he would have first lambasted the whole crew and
        then sunk back into a silent scowl. You know how it is.
        Haven’t you done the same thing when you were the
        charming hostess?” Blynn appealed to them.</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes, indeed,” everyone chorused, including Mrs.
        Levering.</p>

    <p>“There are times,” Kate remembered, “when I am
        strongly tempted to have fake hysterics in the middle of
        the dinner, just to drive them home.”</p>

    <p>“Exactly!” he nodded firmly. “So I avoided a
        scene and drove myself home.” And therefore, one day
        he did not “meet” one fussy little member.</p>

    <p>“I just couldn’t stand that fellow,” Blynn grew
        rigid. “He is a puffy-looking, self-assertive sort of
        nobody. Everybody knows that he was appointed on
        the board because he is a relative of a man who has a
        friend who was able to influence somebody who knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
        somebody who could get him the appointment—one of
        those absurd selections that happen every now and then
        in America, due to the hysteric ambition of some small
        person, helped out by the easy-going American character.
        Well, this Nobody presumes to busy himself
        with the affairs of Holden, talks about it, bothers
        everybody as if he really had judgment. I couldn’t
        trust myself near him. If he had got off any of
        those loud-mouthed advices of his, before others, too,
        I’d have shut him up with his own history. So I concluded
        that the best thing I could do for Diccon was
        to vanish. I came home and locked myself up in the
        University library and hit on a fine trail—I analyzed
        pretty much all the ways in which the Elizabethan
        courtier complimented his lady. There’s little in it for
        subtle minds, but it will make a splendid popular lecture.”</p>

    <p>Then, to avoid what was obviously to him a distressing
        remembrance, he dropped Holden and its affairs and
        told them about the gallant Elizabethan gentlemen.</p>

    <p>“I wonder what the Elizabethan women thought
        about all that stuff,” the practical Gorgas summed up.</p>

    <p>“It isn’t all stuff,” protested the professor.</p>

    <p>“Didn’t the ladies ever reply?” questioned Kate.</p>

    <p>“Not a word,” said Allen. “Their silence is profound.
        Every mother’s son was busy writing sonnets
        to his mistress’ eyebrow, but the ladies stood pat. The
        secret of high diplomacy is, Never divulge; keep ’em
        guessing. And they did!”</p>

    <p>“I wish they had written,” Gorgas was thoughtful.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>“No doubt they felt things as keenly as the men....
        All the men wore beards, I suppose?” she continued irrelevantly.</p>

    <p>“Undoubtedly,” Blynn’s mind was rarely personal.
        The merry face of Gorgas, he did not note at all; nor
        her attempts, with hand at mouth, to hold back a volume
        of laughter; nor Kate’s furtive, elderly signal of rebuke
        to the grinning sister. With eye mostly upon Kate,
        who was presenting a polite face of assumed interest,
        the young professor poured forth a dissertation on
        Elizabethan tonsorial fashions. He was summing up
        his conclusions when his attention was attracted by a
        badly suppressed squeak of laughter from Gorgas.
        “The beard,” he was saying, “was the sign of the
        gentleman, and the sign of the man. Of course they—what
        are you grinning at, you Cheshire kitten? Oh!
        see here, I’ll pluck this thing off tomorrow. I didn’t
        mean to wear it, anyway. It was forced on me by a
        villainous barber.”</p>

    <p>Everyone protested except Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“I think you had better take it off,” she shook her
        head. “I’ve been bubbling with shut-in laughter all
        evening. I like fun, but this—is—carrying things
        a little—too far.” She pushed her laughter back with
        her handkerchief. “I don’t wonder the Elizabethan
        ladies didn’t reply. Poems praising men’s eyes and
        noses and beards! Là! là! <i>là!</i> là! That would be <i>too</i>
        funny!”</p>

    <p>It was a relief to get away from Holden and its small
        politics. Elizabethan lyrics were such a remove. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
        he left them in a cheerful mood and promised to come
        back soon, with his notes, and let them have his amorous
        studies, that substitute for fussy little trustees.</p>

    <p>The next morning his mail brought him an unsigned
        communication in the sprawling hand of Gorgas Levering.
        Evidently she had penned it after he had gone
        the night before. It read:</p>

            THE HOLD-UP</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap2">ALLEN BLYNN’S smile at breakfast that morning
        was quite Pestalozzian. The mother
        looked across at him with much the same seraphic
        glow, simply reflected.</p>

    <p>“Just listen to this from Gorgas, mother. It’s a
        perfect little bit of satire. Oh, this is rich!” He read
        with outright joy.</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first">“I like thee, master, for thy fingers pink</div>
            <div class="verse">That never once hath honest labor smeared;</div>
            <div class="verse">I like thee for thy nose’s Roman kink,</div>
            <div class="verse">But Zooks! I <i>love</i> that waggle, waggle beard!”</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The mother was keen enough to see the cleverness
        and as well the poet’s criticism of her son’s tuft of
        beard.</p>

    <p>“It is rather rough, my dear,” she looked over mildly.</p>

    <p>“Do you think so?” he was surprised. “That’s
        remarkably smooth verse, mother. It just flows
        straight to the point. And the sonnet structure! It’s
        perfect. I don’t think it a bit rough, mother.”</p>

    <p>“I was not considering the verse, my dear,” she managed
        to say. “Motherlike, I was thinking only of my
        son’s ornamented chin. It <i>is</i> rather rough and bristly—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
        chin, not the sonnet. And it does—uh—waggle
        when you talk, my dear.”</p>

    <p>“It goes today, mother,” he eyed the postscript carefully.
        “I’ve pledged my word.” But his mind went
        out to the little girl who was ever tossing odd rhymes
        at him. “I didn’t suspect she could put anything into
        such shape as this. We’ve been reading a lot of verse
        together; it has counted; no doubt, it has counted.”
        The Pestalozzian smile of triumph was still on his face.</p>

    <p>“What wonders you have done with Gorgas,” the
        mother shared his pride.</p>

    <p>That brought him down like a shot.</p>

    <p>“Nonsense!” he exploded. “She’s the only one of
        all my children who has baffled me. Everything she has
        is her own. I try to teach her one thing, she comes
        forth with something different and unexpected—like
        this,” flourishing the sonnet. “She picks her own way
        about. Some children will bloom in spite of teachers;
        but we teachers have a habit of taking credit for all our
        smart ones. Did you ever try to stop a dandelion from
        thriving?”</p>

    <p>Another letter of his small packet was not so consoling.</p>

    <p>“Schmuhl is in town!” he ejaculated. “Diccon says
        I must have luncheon with him at the Union League.”</p>

    <p>“And pray, who is Schmuhl?”</p>

    <p>“A trustee and a big wig,” he explained, but without
        enthusiasm. “He’s a corporation lawyer; never
        seems to work; but he does work, like a rat, in the dark.
        He’s the ‘legislative man’ at Holden. He can do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
        with law-makers. He seems thoroughly gentle
        and harmless. But ... I will not meet him.”</p>

    <p>“Why, my dear?” the mother asked.</p>

    <p>“I shall resign from Holden College and demand that
        my name shall not be considered for the presidency,” he
        went on sternly.</p>

    <p>“If it worries you, my dear,” the mother spoke complacently;
        she had enormous confidence that anything
        her boy should decide to do would be therefore exactly
        right.</p>

    <p>“Without an atom of proof I sense this Schmuhl.
        He makes laws—how, I do not know, but I strongly
        suspect the method. Laws are essential to colleges that
        depend partly on state appropriations. Therefore I
        would need Schmuhl. And I decline to need him! It
        would be a continuous ‘hold-up’ and I decline to be
        ‘held up’ by the Schmuhls of this world. They call
        him respectable; I call him infamous, and I refuse to
        link my life with his!”</p>

    <p>Almost abruptly he left for his writing desk. In a
        short while he was trudging down the street with
        letters in his hand. He strode forward indignantly,
        and he dropped the letters in the corner mail box with
        something of the thrust of a righteous man spurning
        evil. “Top-o’-the Hill” began to loom up as a blessed
        certainty.</p>

    <p>He strode into a barbershop and had the offending
        beard removed; and still striding, he went on to the
        Leverings. On the lawn he met Bardek, Kate, and
        Gorgas; they had not ceased discussing the fortunes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
        Allen. “I have resigned from Holden; I will not be
        a candidate,” he announced bluntly. Briefly he
        sketched his reasons.</p>

    <p>Gorgas and Kate received the news with amazement.
        Already they had begun to feel some of the pride of
        their friend’s success. As Bardek had hinted, the
        “little place” was being called a big name by the world;
        some of the world’s valuation was slowly changing their
        own. It would seem almost like a defeat to back out
        now. They even forgot to notice the absence of the
        beard.</p>

    <p>“It would mean machination and continual intrigue,”
        Blynn shook his head firmly. “And I’m not the man
        for that. Good old Galt. Somehow I begin to see his
        side of the thing. A fine, old sport he was, too; he
        never ‘peached.’ No matter how hard they ran him he
        never whimpered. I wonder what he thought of me—a
        tricky politician, I guess, shouting for ‘the youth of
        America’ and secretly pulling wires for the presidency.
        Ugh! What a job!”</p>

    <p>“My dear good friend,” Bardek interposed. “This
        President Galt, I know him; he is good sport, yes; and
        he twist about and turn and you cannot catch him—yes;
        I know him. But also! He know you. That is
        the business of wise old Galts to know peoples. Oh, he
        know you. From the day he first see you he know you.
        Your face, it is all on the outside—”</p>

    <p>“Gracious! I hope so,” he stroked his face thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” Bardek continued. “You will always be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
        that way. You let your thinkings grow right up, so
        they show in your eyes and around the corners of your
        mouth. You would never make little diplomat—great
        statesman? Yes? Perhaps; for you would fool
        all the little liars and gamblers—they would look on
        your face and see what is to them an unknown t’ing, the
        truth. It is vairy confusing to little statesmen—the
        truth, m’sieu’. When the big Bismarck was in corner
        he quick tell the truth so’s nobody would believe and all
        go the wrong way. Sometime, I, too, have tol’ t’
        truth.”</p>

    <p>“Well, I hope so!” laughed Blynn. “But we’re all
        forgetting the main business in hand. Top-o’-the-Hill
        is emerging out of dreamland into reality. Come, Miss
        Manager, let’s discuss plans. Holden will find my
        resignation in tomorrow’s mail.”</p>

    <p>The plans were even better matured than Blynn had
        hoped for. Kate had kept at work—“To keep my
        mind off Petruchio”—she had told him. Mac had already
        cleaned paths and had made a rough estimate
        of the building needs. There was much to be done
        there; but with some outside hired help, and everybody
        joining in, September should see a school-house prepared
        for those parents who had courage to trust their
        children to the experimenters. Blynn’s work was already
        mapped out on a card. First was the writing
        of the “prospectus.” He could do that “trick” with
        the proper sense and style. It wasn’t to be a pedagogical
        document, but a thriller to win parents over.</p>

    <p>Blynn agreed, but insisted upon one further condition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
        The property must be assessed at a marketable
        figure and a proper rental paid.</p>

    <p>“Trust your manager,” advised Kate. “I don’t
        intend to give anything away. A stock-company is to
        be formed, which will buy the land and house. I will
        take 51 per cent. of the shares as security and to control
        you reckless ones. The stock-company pays taxes and
        improvements; but I insist upon the wild rose and all
        the literary ceremonies.”</p>

    <p>“Right!” agreed Allen. “The first wild rose of
        spring shall be yours; but this is something more than
        poetry; it is almost my only means of livelihood. I
        should be needlessly worried if I felt for a single minute
        that the thing did not pay for itself entirely. I
        cannot live on your property, Kate.”</p>

    <p>“Now, that is vairy strange,” Bardek commented
        when the matter had been made clear to him. “You
        cannot take the ol’ house and little earth.”—He said
        something like “leetle airt,” but it was perfectly clear
        as he spoke it.—“Oh, no! You would have such shame!
        But you would take it quick if I be fool and sell it cheap!
        You cannot take money! But you take rent from poor
        peoples who cannot pay! And you not take my ol’,
        good coat which is now too little for me! Ach! you
        would be beggar! But you take present from me of
        my best workmanship which give me much labor and a
        big pain in t’ back! And you take my dinner at my
        table wit’ no shame at all; and my laughter and all my
        good talk and my friendliness, which take all my life to
        make and cost me—everyt’ing! It is strange! As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
        for me—poof!—I have not the shame. When you
        give and I want, I jus’ take and forget, like wind and
        rain.”</p>

    <p>For the next few days they toiled like slaves on the
        “property.” They dug, planted, cut weeds, sawed and
        even plastered. Bardek secured the help of one or two
        Italians to do the heavy hauling. “Work is good,” he
        argued, “it is the only medicine; but a broken back, it
        is not good. The little men of Italy? Ah! They are
        built so. See how they laugh! I talk to them of Garibaldi
        and zoop! they carry like demons.”</p>

    <p>As they trudged home one weary afternoon, full of
        exultant hopes, a newspaper fell into their hands.
        Blynn’s picture had caught Kate’s quick eye. “Blynn,
        Holden’s Chief,” ran the headlines. It told of a special
        meeting of the board of trustees, and reviewed
        Blynn’s history with the accuracy of a fond parent.
        The vote was 7 to 2.</p>

    <p>“Never you mind,” Blynn grew rigid as he turned
        to his friends. “That won’t go! I told Diccon to
        withdraw my name; I see he didn’t. It’s all right,
        Kate. I’ll get out of this somehow. I’ve been to the
        top of Pisgah; there’ll be no turning back until we
        reach the Promised Land.”</p>

    <p>“Not when I have worked like a coal miner,” implored
        Bardek. “Who would give me my ol’ back
        back?—Oof! <i>wass für eine Sprache!</i> What a language!—give
        a back back! Ho!”</p>

    <p>“That’s good business,” Kate nodded her head, satisfied.
        “I’m glad they elected you. It will boom Top-o’-the-Hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
        immensely. I’ll have it easy financing this
        job. The trouble will be to keep the money from
        swamping us.”</p>

    <p>“‘The President of Holden College resigns to become
        a kindergartner,’” exclaimed Gorgas. “Allen
        Blynn, that’s <i>too</i> funny. It’s almost as funny as the
        waggle-waggle beard!”</p>

    <p>“You minx!” he shook a finger at her. “Are you
        cogitating another sonnet?”</p>

    <p>“I <i>may</i> get on my poet-bonnet!” she smiled at him.</p>

    <p class="drop-cap2">AT the suggestion of Gorgas, Leopold became a
        member of the staff of “Top-o’-the-Hill.”
        Of all the old group that used to make rendezvous
        of the Levering house, Leopold and Blynn were the
        only two who kept up the relationship; but both men
        were rather intermittent visitors. Leopold—everyone
        said “Leopold,” possibly because of the impossible surname,
        Hayim—called punctiliously upon Mrs. Levering,
        although Mrs. Levering saw little of him. Gorgas
        and he spent the time exercising their French. He was
        a silent, grave man, with a far-off friendly smile; and,
        once enticed, he could talk out of a rare life. On festival
        occasions he could always be counted upon for a
        plaintive song.</p>

    <p>“Leopold will do the science, you know,” Gorgas explained.
        “I have talked it over with him. You should
        have seen his fine eyes sparkle! He’s got heaps of
        money, you know; we’ll make him treasurer. Besides,
        he’s English. That will give <i>such</i> a tone!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>What a varied group it was! At night they drew
        up the staff as it would be printed in the “prospectus.”
        The list of names and qualifications was almost formidable
        when one considered how informal and unregulated
        all their teaching hoped to be; and in that list they
        stumbled over the name of Bardek. He would never
        admit any other names. “Jus’ Bardek,” he would say.
        “Why have more than one name? Even one is hard
        to remember.” Here is the first faculty of “Top-o’-the-Hill,”
        that prototype of the “new schools” which
        were soon to spring up all over America:</p>

    <p class="center">
        <span class="smcap">In Charge</span>:<br>

        <span class="smcap">Mr. Allen Blynn</span><br>
        Holden and Jena<br>
        <br>
        <span class="smcap">Miss Keyser Levering</span><br>
        The Warren School<br>
        <br>
        <span class="smcap">Associates</span>:<br>

        <span class="smcap">Mr. Hayim Leopold</span><br>
        Harrow and Cambridge<br>
        <br>
        <span class="smcap">Mr. Bardek</span><br>
        Naples and Bordeaux<br>
        <br>
        <span class="smcap">Miss Gorgas Levering</span><br>
        School of Applied Arts
    </p>

    <p>“It sounds so learned,” Allen looked on ruefully.
        “We oughtn’t to print it.”</p>

    <p>“It ought to sound learned,” said Kate.</p>

    <p>“But we are to deal with young life, not learning,”
        he reminded her.</p>

    <p>“We’ll do all of that,” she assured him. “This list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
        of names is just advertising. No one will question us
        after they see all our vast qualifications; they won’t even
        inquire if we have them. This,” tapping the sheet,
        “will bring us more paying pupils than any other page
        in the pamphlet. I know these people. ‘Jena,’
        ‘Bordeaux,’ ‘Harrow,’ ‘Cambridge’—why, that’s as
        good as paying dividends already. You watch.”</p>

    <p>“When you go fishing, my friend,” Bardek’s eyes
        twinkled, “it would be big fool if you not put on the
        dying worm or the already dead insect. Of <i>course</i>,”
        spreading his hands, “you might say to the fish, ‘Come,
        jump on my hook; it won’t hurt you any worse jus’
        because the dead insect is not there. Come; quick; get
        it over.’ Ah! no! The fish are too wise.</p>

    <p>“Titles and degrees and all that,” Bardek went on,
        “they are vairy great power. We see little men wit’
        big decorations, and we come to them and ask questions,
        and prod them with the stick of our minds, and we turn
        them round and round and open their mouths and look
        down their throats. How we tremble! At any minute
        dese great man may say some wise thing! And you
        stay and stay for hundert t’ousand years and he say,
        nothing—nothing that you don’t know when you were
        small boy. ‘It look like rain,’ maybe he say after two,
        t’ree thousand years. But the world! Ah! It walks
        in a great wide circle and will not come near the great
        man. Mystery! Mystery! They are afraid of his
        wisdom. It will strike them dead, like lightning. So
        they send their children to him.</p>

    <p>“And the children! First they are afraid—they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
        believe then all the papa and mamma has tol’ dem.
        Then they find he don’t know what happened in the
        world day before it was yesterday. And soon they
        laugh. Then he grow red in face and scold; and then
        because they have pains of laughter they stop. And
        all their days they meet ol’ school friend and they sit
        and drink and eat and laugh at that ol’ fool who did not
        know what happens the day before it was yesterday.</p>

    <p>“And t’en t’ey send <i>dere</i> children to him and make
        beeg stories how great is that man!</p>

    <p>“Oh, put the dead insect on the hook, my friend: or
        there will be no little pupils and we will be so hungry
        to teach t’at we fall on each other and teach.”</p>

    <p>It was precisely as Kate had predicted. She seemed
        to know exactly where to drop her printed bait. By
        August she had closed the doors and had engineered a
        waiting list, for they were resolved the first year to begin
        with small numbers.</p>

    <p>“We’ll pay you your wages and have something besides
        for improvements,” she announced to Blynn.</p>

    <p>Of all that enthusiastic lot of teachers he was the
        only one who could not afford to give his time without
        salary. It hurt him to take that money, but his good
        sense showed him that there was no other way out. It
        was shame of the sort that Bardek thought so strange,
        and it must be downed. He reflected with some grimness
        that while the others were giving energy, joy, and
        enthusiasm to the work, he was offering all that and
        something much harder to give, his pride as an independent
        man.</p>

    <p>To no one he spoke of this. In spite of his innocence
        and in spite of the face which, as Bardek claimed, he
        wore for the most part “on the outside,” Blynn could
        mask a hundred worries back of his Pestalozzian smile.
        Yet Gorgas knew. She had pieced together his jests
        and his half-uttered opinions.</p>

    <p>They had worked all day together on a baseball diamond
        and were celebrating the conclusion by a picnic
        supper on the grounds of “Top-o’-the-Hill.”</p>

    <p>“Mein guter Kamarade,” she whispered, “you
        mustn’t feel bad about that fool salary.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I don’t,” he smiled.</p>

    <p>“Yes, you do,” she nodded wisely. “I’m onto your
        curves, old chap. I’ll just have to talk to you like a
        Dutch uncle. I’ve a scheme, too; better than anything
        Kate gets off. <i>Now</i>—mustn’t it be grand?”</p>

    <p>“Phew!” he affected seriousness. “It must be a
        corker. Let’s hear it.”</p>

    <p>“Here? Wouldn’t that be funny,” she asked herself
        aloud. “Wouldn’t that be <i>too</i> funny!” The idea
        amused her. “Oh, no, <i>mon capitaine</i>, not here before
        all these folks. It’s—it’s private. Yes,” she mused,
        “it’s quite private.... You must let me have an interview.
        I’ve been trying to have one with you ever
        since June.”</p>

    <p>“Why, my dear child!” he was surprised. “We’ve
        been together nearly every blessed day, taken walks together
        and all that!”</p>

    <p>“Yes, I know,” she said. “I’ve tried to say it—and
        couldn’t. But I’m going to dive in soon. That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
        what I came to your house for, in June; you remember
        when you were teaching the Croft boy? If he hadn’t
        been there I’d have done it then. Hush!” she raised
        a finger. “They’re coming back. Not a word....
        It’s partly about <i>him</i>.” She nudged toward Leopold.</p>

    <p>That was an exasperating way to end a conversation,
        characteristic of Gorgas—just like an exciting continuous
        story. “It’s partly about <i>him</i>.” About Leopold?</p>

    <p>Leopold had never ceased his subtle interest in Gorgas
        since the night of their first conversation in French.
        He was both French and English, and, back of that, the
        Oriental. He seemed ever ready to do two contradictory
        things; to leap into the breach and seize the enemy
        by the throat, or to stand, courageous as the day, and
        undisturbed take every shock. One of these—the
        French or the English—might have won out and given
        him a positive emotional character, but the persistent
        Hebrew, trained to keep emotions in check, to pass them
        in review before hard, good sense, held the two contrary
        horses together and dominated from the driver’s
        seat. One needs a mixed metaphor to describe Leopold.</p>

    <p>There was much more to Leopold than that—what
        forked, straddling biped can be summed up in a phrase?—he
        had the smile of compassion and the hovering
        sadness of those who have looked upon the world from
        afar off, who have travelled sympathetically among
        peoples and have seen the splendid futility of the life
        effort.</p>

    <p>It was generally believed that Leopold was rich. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
        admitted a competence, but his life was simple. Ah!
        Blynn had a swift thought of comprehension. Leopold
        was to furnish the salary! That was it. Wise little
        Gorgas had thought to dissipate a man’s pride in being
        self-supporting by shifting the source of income from
        a stock-company to a person! Women will never understand
        that side of man, he mused; the fierce hatred
        of leaning upon another. In illness women are meek
        and saintly; when men become sick and incapacitated
        they grow unbearable, their maimed spirits cry out
        against the very charity that would make them whole.
        Women live in dependence without shame. They take
        furs and carriages and spending money from their
        fathers. Even a boy of sixteen begins to rebel. He
        cannot take things, even from fathers; he must earn.</p>

    <p>Over the sprightly little fire Blynn told them of Diccon.</p>

    <p>“You know how mean I felt because I had to leave
        him in the lurch,” he said. “Well! Diccon was just
        fine about it. He said he suspected that turn of affairs
        all along and had prepared for it.</p>

    <p>“What a loyal chap that Diccon is! He said his
        only interest was in having the post officially tendered
        me; he really didn’t care what I did with it. He said
        just what you remarked the other day, that the election
        would make my name valuable anywhere else I went.
        I told him about ‘Top-o’-the-Hill.’ He said, ‘Bully!
        It’ll be a great go. Put me on the trustees, will you?’”</p>

    <p>“Let’s!” suggested Gorgas. “I like Diccon. He’s
        got sense. We haven’t.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“What!” they shouted.</p>

    <p>“We’re dreaming,” she nodded wisely. “We need
        his kind to prevent us soaring right up in the air like
        a balloon and—”</p>

    <p>“And go bust, eh?” continued Bardek.</p>

    <p>“Just that,” said Gorgas. “We need ballast
        badly.”</p>

    <p>They could hardly eat, these dreamers, until the new
        idea had been incorporated. A board of advisers was
        drawn up to give ballast: it included Diccon, and the
        rector of Grace Church, the butter-and-egg man, others
        of the tennis-court group, and three influential
        “mothers.”</p>

    <p>“We’ll get out a second edition of the prospectus,”
        Kate smiled her satisfaction. “That front page will
        look slick! We’ll charge ’em two hundred next year.”</p>

    <p>Bardek brought the Italian laborers to the picnic
        supper. They demurred mightily at first, but Gorgas
        won them by a neat speech of invitation in Italian.
        How their eyes glistened, not for the good things to
        eat, although that must have touched them, but for
        the sound of that rich Italian speech.</p>

    <p>“They are so hungry for words,” laughed Bardek;
        “the sound of your own language in a strange land—ah!
        that is sweet. One day I pass an ol’ woman wit’
        bundle of sticks and she say, ‘Dam t’ose t’ings; t’ey
        won’t stay on my ol’ head’; but she say it in Czech, the
        clicking-clacking Czech which my mother spoke to me.”
        He burst into a strange rattle of exclamations. “That
        is the sweet Czech, my friends. It sounds not so sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
        to you, eh? No? Your ear it is not right. Suppose
        you was in the middle of China and could never go to
        your home and, quick, you hear little children wit’ high
        American voice sing in the evening,</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first2">‘Here we go ’round the mulberry bush,</div>
            <div class="verse">Mulberry bush, mulberry bush,</div>
            <div class="verse">Here we go ’round the mulberry bush,</div>
            <div class="verse">So early in the morning.’</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“Ach! Gott, would you not cry?</p>

    <p>“I did cry and hug that ol’ woman and tell her in
        her own Czech that I be long-gone son. And she believe
        me! I make her say, ‘Dam t’ose sticks,’ five, ten
        times and give her silver dollar for each time she speak.
        Ach! if she do not go mad after that! Somewhere in
        America is a crazy woman, all her life-time singing and
        shouting, ‘Dam t’ose sticks!’”</p>

    <p>“We’ve caught you at last, Bardek,” Gorgas cried.
        “You are Czech! That’s what you are!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no!” he protested. “I am cosmopolitan.
        My mother, she was Czech when I was boy; but before
        t’at she was many t’ings; and after, many t’ings. I am
        cosmopolitan,” he claimed again. To Leopold and to
        Gorgas he spoke in French, to Blynn he made his remarks
        in German, and to the Italians he talked in their
        own tongue. The very <i>timbre</i> and rhythm of his voice
        changed with each language; he had the music of each
        in his head.</p>

    <p>“Ask Caproni, here,” he boasted, “if I am not
        Italian.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>Gorgas inquired in their language.</p>

    <p>“Him?” their eyes opened in surprise at the question.
        “Oh, but, yes, milady. He is grand signor,
        Italian gentleman. He has lived in Milan, Napoli,
        everywhere, even in our own Sicily. Italian? Oh, but
        yes. French? You would make fun, milady? He
        speak French as we in Sicily speak French; ah! he talk
        Italian from the heart.”</p>

    <p>While Gorgas translated, Bardek sat transfigured.</p>

    <p>“You see!” he shook his great, round head in pride.</p>

    <p>“And I would take oath you are French,” Leopold
        remarked quietly. “You have tones and nuances of the
        Loire—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes, I have lived on the Loire,” he admitted,
        “and also in Brittany.” For example, he shifted back
        and forth between the patois of the north and south of
        France.</p>

    <p>“I say again that I am cosmopolitan,” he averred.
        “The Bohemian belongs to all countries. In New York
        city is a Bohemia which New York city does not know.
        There we talk all languages and listen to the pulses
        of the world. New York is a little place, full of the
        small thinkings of little places. It has great pride
        and wonderful industry—just like little places—but
        of the doings of the great world, it knows everything
        too late. Long before the big wars the Bohemia of
        New York city knows what is to be, and prepares; one
        day New York city wake up and scream the stale news.
        So wit’ everyt’ing.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>“But I should not so talk,” he shook his head sadly.
        “I am no longer cosmopolitan.”</p>

    <p>They tried for some time to get him to tell them why.
        At first he would not speak. Sadness enveloped him.
        After a while he laughed.</p>

    <p>“I am not sorry; it is good,” he said, with characteristic
        optimism. “In America one cannot be cosmopolitan,
        I see. America is too strong, it sucks t’ blood
        out. In Europe I could change my skin and still be—deep—myself,
        Bardek, Citizen of No Place. Always
        I could be French and still look on like foreign; or
        German or Dutch or Spanish or Polish or Italian or
        anyt’ing. Jus’ so I be in America for long time. Zen
        somet’ing happen to me. I eat poison grass, or somet’ing.
        My skin, it does not change; it gets tough.</p>

    <p>“Sometimes when I talk French or Italian to my
        boys or to Miss Gorgas, I must stop and t’ink for the
        word. Me, Bardek, stop to think! It is terrible, my
        friend, to have big things bubbling inside and no word
        at the mout’! And always the English word, it come.
        And such English! Ach! My boys, dey laugh and
        make fun—when they t’ink I do not look—and they
        say, ‘Dago.’ Oof! Sometimes I beat t’em in six
        languages; but, sometimes, too, I laugh.... ‘Dago!’
        It is so.”</p>

    <p>A chorus of protests told him how well he spoke
        English.</p>

    <p>Leopold scolded him for his desponding. “It is
        thinking that counts, my dear Bardek,” he said, “not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
        words. Greek is a wonderful language, but without
        Plato or Homer and Aesculus or Sophocles and Aristophanes,
        it would be a dead instrument. You <i>think</i>,
        my dear Bardek. If you spoke in Pennsylvania-Dutch
        you would be worth listening to.”</p>

    <p>“And your English is better than English,” spoke up
        the loyal Gorgas. “It is softer and lovelier and beautifully
        strange.”</p>

    <p>“Thank you,” he smiled. “I like you to say zat.
        A good lie, you owe it to a friend, to make him happy.
        What! You laugh? But it is not sin to lie. You
        do not read your Bible, my friend. To kill? steal? yes.
        To bear false witness? yes. But the good Moses was
        too wise to say, ‘Thou shalt not lie.’... Yet I am
        ‘Dago,’ jus’ like dese Italian ol’ men.</p>

    <p>“Oh, I know; it is right,” he continued. “The Italian,
        oh, he will come to America and he say, ‘I will
        live like pig and make much money and go back to my
        country and live like prince. Yah! He stay wit’ his
        own people and talk, talk, talk his own speech. He
        laugh at funny Americans. Yah! Soon he must hide
        his fine clothes of colors and put on grease-pants and
        ol’ hat. It is not good to make money when peoples
        laugh. Yah! And zen he must learn little English,
        and he speak ‘Dago,’ jus’ like me. Or how can he make
        the much money, eh? Yah! To his little boys and
        girls he talk ze good language of his own land; but
        zey? Ach! Zey will not. In ze house, yes; so not to
        get ze beatings. But in ze street, là! là! <i>là!</i> là! Gabble,<span class="pagenum"
            id="Page_351">[351]</span>
        gabble, gabble. Some day zey make fun of daddy
        and wink and say, ‘Dago!’</p>

    <p>“And he is ‘Dago.’ Soon he find himself talking
        ‘Dago’ in house, even wit’ his wife. Once he fight and
        beat her and all cry curses—in his own speech? Ah,
        no; in ‘Dago.’ He call her ‘Dam dog’ and she say to
        him ‘Go t’ ’ell!’ and zen he is done. His skin cannot
        change. All his life he is not’ing—he is American.”</p>

    <p>It was the strong America seizing on the immigrant
        and twisting him into a new mold. The children would
        be Americans, but the old ones, they were wrecked in
        the process. The Germans became “Dutchmen”; the
        Irish became “Micks”; the Poles became “Hunkies,”
        and the Italians “Dagos.”</p>

    <p>“But sometimes they go back,” ventured Blynn.</p>

    <p>Bardek laughed at the picture his mind conjured.</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes, they go back. Là! là! <i>là!</i> là! What a
        comic! The people of their own land rush out of t’
        house to see t’ funny t’ing. Là! là! <i>là!</i> là! The dead
        clot’es of ragman! The gol’ watch-chain for t’ tie big
        dog! Zen they talk! It is no language. Perhaps
        they stay to be comic all their lives? Ah, no. For
        they get sick for America, where the little boys and girls
        go to school. They do not rest till zey go back and be
        once more ‘Dago.’”</p>

    <p>The twilight came slowly about them while they lingered
        over the camp-fire. Some of Bardek’s brooding
        spirit had infected them; but it did not drive them
        home. Night began to make its claims for a habitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
        and the stars of a fine August evening shone clear,
        yet they stayed to hear Leopold talk of his boyhood
        days at Harrow. Finally they joined hands with him
        and formed the circle about the ebbing fire—as Harrow
        “old boys” have done for generations—while they
        sang the Harrow parting song:</p>

            THE BIOLOGIST AND THE PURITAN</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">THE solemnity of the parting song had driven
        Bardek off alone. Allen and Kate walked
        along ahead, but at the Pennsylvania Railroad
        tracks, a dark, forbidding place, Allen insisted
        upon stopping to wait for Gorgas and Leopold, who
        were straggling far in the rear. Fumbling accidentally
        in his pockets, Blynn produced his morning mail, two
        letters, still unopened. They moved up to the lights
        of the station to see what it would disclose. One was
        from Gorgas—she had a habit of jotting notes to persons
        she met every day. He glanced at it hurriedly,
        but in the bad light did not catch the full meaning.
        The other letter set him dancing.</p>

    <p>“Can you spare me for the remainder of the month,
        Madam Manager, and part of September?” he asked.
        His eyes showed good news.</p>

    <p>“Is it money?” the practical manager asked first.</p>

    <p>“Bushels!” he cried. “Diccon has booked a series
        of lectures in a string of cities,” he read, “Rochester,
        Ithaca, Albany, Providence and Boston. I cover the
        route three times, fifteen lectures in five weeks, at—what
        do you think? One hundred dollars each and expenses!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“How much is that altogether?” Kate was figuring.</p>

    <p>“I don’t know. I’m so excited, I can’t count.
        One hundred apiece—child’s play! I’ve got ’em all
        done. Isn’t it great! and isn’t it robbery! ‘Each
        local center pays three hundred dollars,’ he read, ‘and
        expenses, which makes it one hundred dollars per lecture.
        I hope this is not too slight an honorarium.’
        Golly! Too slight? Let me confess something, Kate.
        I don’t take any pennies out of the cash-drawer of
        Top-o’-the-Hill. By George! you don’t know how
        splendid I feel to be able to face those children like a
        man. That ‘salary’—oh, you were managing it
        beautifully, I know—but that ‘salary’ was choking
        me, even before I got any. I’m glad that’s all over and
        settled.”</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>They were strolling toward home through the wooded
        Seminary grounds, on which site once stood the old
        “Classical and Military Lyceum,” where Beauregarde,
        Meade and many another Northern and Southern
        officer received preliminary training. Over these same
        grounds, in 1777, came Sullivan’s men, driving the
        British advance post before them; and a little later, on
        that October morning, General Washington rode down
        the “Great Road” with his eager staff.</p>

    <p>“I dug a cannon-ball out of my garden the other
        day,” Allen remarked abruptly. The thrill of the evening
        was upon them and they had had no need for
        speech; but if the man would talk, Kate would tuck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
        her hand in his arm and be content. “A little round,
        rusty thing, about as big as your fist—it made me
        a little more reverent toward this old battleground....
        The Continentals came up out of the fog over
        there,” he pointed earnestly, although it was almost
        too dark to see him, “surprised the pickets in the
        Allen House and bayoneted every one—poor devils!...
        They swept on over this ground, firing from behind
        trees, for the Fifty-second British Light Infantry,
        who were tenting over there in the fields beyond the
        New Street, were stirring out like hornets—and such
        a bugling and banging there must have been!...
        The Fifty-second put up a running fight and weren’t
        able to make a stand for nearly a mile.... Think of
        it! Washington himself followed right after Sullivan’s
        men—perhaps he rode over this very spot!...
        Doesn’t it excite you?”</p>

    <p>“Not a bit, Sentimental Sir,” she laughed coolly.</p>

    <p>“You are standing, mebbe, on historic spots,
        madam!” he mocked her laughter with assumed sternness.
        “That battle came near to deciding everything—think
        of the historic persons who struggled here—Washington
        and Wayne, and Lafayette, and—and—”</p>

    <p>“And me,” she helped.</p>

    <p>“Since when have you become an historic person,
        madam?”</p>

    <p>“‘On this spot,’” she quoted an imaginary stone,
        “‘one wonderful evening late in August in the year
        eighteen hundred and ninety-two, stood Keyser Levering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
        familiarly known as Kate, with her arm linked comfortably
        in that of a poetic but pleasant person
        otherwise unknown.’... Washington and Lafayette
        were nice boys,” said she, “and that battle was their
        fun, but standing here very much alive and living my
        little life is all the history I’ll ever have; so I’ve got
        to make the most of it.... Sentimental Sir, aren’t
        you going to get all worked up over historic me, standing
        here?—or do I have to be dead before it is proper
        to become really stirred?”</p>

    <p>She waited expectantly. Kate had told her story
        to this man in as many veiled ways as is permitted to a
        lady; but each time he had looked at her earnestly, as
        if she had propounded a serious riddle. And always
        it amused her—at least she smiled gamely—to see
        how really obtuse this clever man could be. This
        time, in the darkening night, she could not see his eyes
        as he bent forward; but she felt his arm tighten and
        the brotherly pat of his hand upon her own.</p>

    <p>“You’re all right, Kate,” he said; and then, “Good
        old Kate!” which he repeated with great satisfaction.
        A second later, he asked irrelevantly, “Where are those
        children?” meaning Gorgas and Leopold.</p>

    <p>They peered fruitlessly into the darkness, and even
        retraced their steps a part of the way down the Valley,
        but there was no sign of them.</p>

    <p>“They have felt the spell of the evening and have
        tracked off,” Kate suggested. “Didn’t Leopold do
        that song well? ‘Forty year on when afar and asunder,’”
        she sang. “It gave me a thrill, I tell you.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“Me, too,” Blynn pressed his lips together. “And
        how he felt it! Did you see him straining to keep the
        tears back? Think what it meant to him, that old
        parting song of Harrow!”</p>

    <p>The floating melody and the words of the song lingered.
        By association, the thought of Gorgas came
        into their minds.</p>

    <p>“They’ll be home before us,” Kate spoke out.
        “While we’ve been dawdling along they have probably
        taken some short cut. It may be Gorgas has dragged
        Leopold on one of her ‘bee-lines.’”</p>

    <p>“Well, well!” Blynn laughed. “At night, too.
        Gorgas claims that’s to be one of the studies in Top-o’-the-Hill.
        ‘Cut a straight path,’ she says, ‘like a
        bee, only bee-ier:</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first2">‘Through bush, through briar,</div>
            <div class="verse">Ice, rain, water, fire;</div>
            <div class="verse">Over river, up tree,</div>
            <div class="verse">Bee-ier than a flying bee,</div>
            <div class="verse">Through hedge and over gate,</div>
            <div class="verse">Straight! straight! straight! straight!’</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“She goes up one side of a tree and down the other
        like a squirrel! I was on one last Wednesday.
        Phew! She chose a southeast ‘bee-line’ and insisted
        upon fording the Schuylkill river, clothes and all!
        She said her conscience wouldn’t let her back out. I
        just had to follow to keep her from mischief.”</p>

    <p>They were not at home, however, when Kate and
        Allen arrived, nor did they come in for hours after.
        Then Gorgas walked in alone. She was rather disheveled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
        With only a slight word of greeting, she
        went up the stairs as if she were tired out.</p>

    <p>“Another ‘bee-line,’ Gorgas?” Blynn asked cheerfully.</p>

    <p>She stopped on the landing and looked back at him.</p>

    <p>“You bet!” she nodded almost angrily and moved
        swiftly up the stairs.</p>

    <p>“What is a ‘bee-line’?” Leopold, at the doorway,
        asked quietly. He was spick and orderly as ever,
        save that his tie was completely off its moorings and
        hanging over his left shoulder.</p>

    <p>Blynn explained, quoting the verses of the game, and
        joked about the tell-tale tie.</p>

    <p>“Ah!” Leopold adjusted the cravat thoughtfully.
        “She did not give a name to it.”</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>That night Blynn and Leopold walked home together.
        They talked of Gorgas as if the theme had
        been set in advance. She came abruptly into their
        conversation, but so intent was each upon his own
        thought that neither considered the need of apology or
        explanation. Without introduction, Leopold began:</p>

    <p>“She is beautifully unschooled. It is a rare thing
        nowadays to meet a natural woman—and with the
        beginnings of a mind.”</p>

    <p>“Sometimes,” Blynn pondered as he talked, “I have
        taken pride in having shaped that mind of hers. But—she
        is herself, and would have been herself without
        any help or hindrance from me.”</p>

    <p>“You have done much for her,” Leopold protested.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>“Nonsense!”</p>

    <p>“Much! I recognize it. Some of your Puritan conscience
        is in her.”</p>

    <p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

    <p>Leopold pondered in turn. “Tonight she—and
        on other nights, too—she—but I can’t give illustrations.”</p>

    <p>Blynn looked at him. “I think I understand,” he
        brightened up. “She is just naturally moral.”</p>

    <p>Leopold laughed quietly. “Moral! What a
        wretched word!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I don’t mean—”</p>

    <p>“Don’t explain, friend Allen. I know you don’t
        mean the little prudential codes of playing safe and getting
        on in life. You mean that she has principles of
        conduct which she has thought out—”</p>

    <p>“No,” explained Blynn. “I don’t mean that at all.
        She has principles of conduct, all right, but they are
        not thought out; they are instinctive. She plays fair
        by instinct; she couldn’t want to take advantage: not
        because she has reasoned the thing out, but because—because
        she just knows it isn’t the square thing to do.
        And then she has a powerful lot of self-respect without
        a trace of vanity. She—”</p>

    <p>The two men interrupted each other continually.
        That was their method—tossing the idea back and
        forth.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” Leopold took it up, “she fights reason without
        any reason at all, and won’t let herself go. She
        admits things with delicious candor; she has wants and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
        owns up to them, but she won’t let herself satisfy them.
        She knows her instincts, but she holds them down.”</p>

    <p>“Good!” Blynn commented. “She has character.
        Control—that’s the whole of character. But we’re
        talking very vaguely. Wants! Instincts! What
        sort? They may be friends or enemies.”</p>

    <p>“Ha!” Leopold interjected gleefully. “That’s her
        very phrase! I can see your coaching there, old boy!
        And you’ve done a good job—so far.”</p>

    <p>“I’m glad,” said Blynn simply. The thoughts of
        the two men were on totally different levels. For over
        an hour that night off in Cresheim Valley, Leopold had
        been matching his instincts against that very control
        which meant in Gorgas, character. All the rushing
        events of that tremulous night were in his mind as he
        talked; but Blynn, characteristically, considered only
        the general application of his theory. “I’m glad,” he
        went on. “I wasn’t sure. Her mother is practically
        useless to her—so is her sister, for that matter. I
        have planted a few seed-ideas, that is all. If they’ve
        rooted, I’m glad. But, gracious me! She’s had no
        chance to test herself. That may come; but it will be
        later, when she’s older and better able to be her own
        master. She’s quite sheltered here. No one will
        bother her here. What—”</p>

    <p>Blynn stopped speaking. A self-satisfied exclamation
        from Leopold arrested his thinking. Some of his
        own dormant instincts began to tug at his mind—suspicion,
        among others and a swift, unreasoned touch of
        jealousy; but he checked himself and went on. “Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
        course, I have been able to do very little. A man
        must generalize, he must—”</p>

    <p>“She understood all your generalizations,” Leopold
        interrupted.</p>

    <p>“Did she say—but—how could you know?”</p>

    <p>“She told me.”</p>

    <p>“Told you what?”</p>

    <p>“Well, among other things, she told me your story
        of the pale wanderer who turned a whole city full of
        people into lepers. Ugh! That was an ugly dose!
        It got into her, somehow, and sickened her. It has
        made her afraid to let go. Leper! Ugh! How could
        you?”</p>

    <p>“Because it is life,” Blynn spoke warmly. “Ignorance
        is the only sin. You remember your Socrates.
        If we really knew all, he said, we would never embrace
        evil. Ignorance makes our criminals, it makes our
        slums, it brings into the world cripple-minded children,
        it separates mothers and fathers, breeds disease, and
        corrupts the best of us. We don’t take evil into our
        lives because we believe it to be evil, but because we
        ignorantly think it good.”</p>

    <p>“Phew!” Leopold affected concern. “You <i>are</i> a
        Puritan! Scratch a Puritan and find a preacher!...
        Well; you’ve made her half a Puritan—you and
        your ghastly leper—and it is a good thing.” Leopold
        nodded sagely. “At first, I did not like it. It
        seemed inconsistent with her strong sense of individual
        freedom. I am not much of a Puritan myself. I obey
        my will. I do not let it be balked by creed or dictum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
        made by others. And I have always believed in giving
        the same freedom to everyone. That is my idea of
        tolerance. But she is not that way—and, strange, I
        am glad!”</p>

    <p>They talked for a desultory moment on freedom and
        restrictions, but Leopold came back to Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“She is not wholly Puritan,” he explained. “At
        times—no; at other times—tonight, for instance—she
        takes fright, calls on her little gods, and fights.
        You it is, I gather, who have planted that in her—”</p>

    <p>“Oh, no!” Blynn protested grimly. The generalities
        of Leopold began to assume horrid, specific
        meanings. His slow mind was racing to catch up with
        the events. The “bee-line,” the angry, disheveled Gorgas
        mounting the stairs, the cravat so accusingly
        awry—what did they mean? Suddenly his memory
        began to piece data together, material that had been
        observed by his eyes, that had been recorded on the
        phonographic-disk of a brain, but which never before
        had been summoned into consciousness. The pictures
        that he conjured made him ill, and as he walked he
        drew in deep breaths to steady himself. “Oh, no!”
        he repeated, while his mind throbbed, “I taught her
        nothing. She has her own character, predestined to
        grow into its own as an oak from an acorn. You can’t
        spread morals on children like stucco on a wall. Character
        is the self revealed. You can only bring it out.
        But with Gorgas I didn’t even bring it out. It was
        always there.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>“I believe you,” Leopold answered. “You are
        quite right. And I am glad. Strange that I should
        want in a woman the qualities that I do not respect
        myself.”</p>

    <p>“You want—Gorgas?”</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>Leopold went on calmly, but Allen only half heeded
        him; through the dark they strode, the biologist pursuing
        serenely his theory, the other hearing only the
        turmoil of his own wild thoughts. Finally the pleasant
        voice at his side caught Allen’s attention. Leopold
        was saying:</p>

    <p>“There is something, after all, in that old worship
        of chastity in women—the ‘double-standard,’ as we
        call it today—something more than merely the echo
        of the age of chivalry or the offshoot of the worship
        of the Virgin. It is an ingrained necessity, I am finding.
        A man must be sure of his woman. Faithfulness,
        constancy, unconquerability—those are the
        qualities that hold us. If the woman surrenders easily,
        we men suspect that the next comer will have the same
        victory. Then the Othello-Desdemona business! The
        ideal method, I fancy, is savage seizure, like the Sabines.
        The longer they struggle, the longer they’ll stay contented
        in captivity. I’m a biologist. In biology all
        mating is war of sex. Gorgas—well—let me give
        you an added confidence—tonight I took her in my
        arms forcibly—”</p>

    <p>“Leopold!” Blynn clutched him by the arm.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>“Don’t be alarmed, my Puritan friend,” Leopold
        laughed pleasantly. “I am simply courting that
        young lady—”</p>

    <p>“She is only a child!” Blynn gasped.</p>

    <p>“She is seventeen—will be eighteen shortly. Biology
        calls that quite old enough.”</p>

    <p>Blynn dropped his grasp. “She is only a child,”
        he repeated firmly.</p>

    <p>“My mother was married and had children at seventeen,”
        Leopold considered for a moment. The agitation
        of his companion was hid by the darkness.
        “Child? Oh, no, my dear Allen—she is a full-grown
        woman—charged with womanhood. Well, she broke
        away tonight.... At first, I was angry—then I
        was glad. Her resistance is the measure of her constancy....
        You don’t mind my talking out this way,
        old fellow.”</p>

    <p>“No! no! Go on!”</p>

    <p>But he did not go on. Leopold’s sensitiveness was
        slowly taking account of the long stride of the man
        by his side. As they passed a street-lamp he saw the
        white face staring ahead into the night, and caught the
        firm lips and the long, deep breathing.</p>

    <p>“You are fond of her?” Leopold asked mildly.</p>

    <p>No answer; but in that vibrating moment words
        were not essential.</p>

    <p>Unconscious of direction, the two men had been
        marching on across the city-line, and were now pacing
        through a deeply wooded lane in Montgomery county.</p>

    <p>“I always fancied it was a purely pedagogic interest,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
        Leopold remarked, as if to the trees lined thick
        along the road.</p>

    <p>Again there was no answer.</p>

    <p>“So!” Leopold spoke with sympathy. “I did not
        know. Forgive me.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, that’s all right.”</p>

    <p>They tramped along sturdily.</p>

    <p>“Have you told her that you—”</p>

    <p>“Merciful heavens!” Blynn broke forth; but restrained
        further speech.</p>

    <p>“Why not?” Leopold asked kindly.</p>

    <p>“She is a child. Oh, yes! yes! yes!” he struck down
        the attempted interruption. “I have taken her by the
        hand and led her as an older brother might take his
        little sister. I have watched over her ... talked to
        her of books, of life, of God.... I have been the confidant
        of her little troubles and have—have—tried
        to give her courage and—understanding. She has
        opened the door of her life to me. I have stepped
        within and have broken bread with her. Now ...
        how could I desecrate ... how could I sully ... I
        don’t mean that. It is hard for me to say, Leopold.
        I can’t explain it to you. To me she is still a serious-eyed,
        fearless child, who has come to me in the perfect
        faith of innocence.... My reason doesn’t tell me
        that. My reason tells me to go and seize her, fight
        you for her, and carry her off. But there’s something
        else.... You call it Puritan.... Maybe it is racial,
        or an inheritance. Maybe it is only superstition.
        Whatever it is, it holds me fast. I am chained, bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
        absolutely. I cannot speak. I cannot go to that
        child and—and—unmask.... Let’s go back.”</p>

    <p>They turned and trudged along the uneven road
        without speaking until a stray light or two along the
        Chestnut Hill Pike told them they were coming back
        into the village.</p>

    <p>“I have been wondering,” Leopold spoke thoughtfully,
        “what it is that draws us to our mates. Nobody
        knows. It is the greatest mystery in creation. Let us
        face the facts: Gorgas is a remarkable girl; she
        thinks; she has unusual abilities. Good! But that is
        not what draws us. I know dozens of women who are
        her superior—women whose conversation is—well!—shall
        I say more congenial? The truth is, Gorgas
        is not ready to enter on an intellectual level with either
        of us. In fact—well!—her education must be kept
        up—uh—afterwards. You are right; in many respects
        she is yet a child. I see things as a biologist:
        I fancy that her charm, after all, is her youth and her
        astonishing health. That is the mating cry—health.”</p>

    <p>“If you don’t mind, Leopold,” Blynn stopped, “I’ll
        leave you here and cut off across this field alone.”</p>

    <p>Leopold laughed pleasantly.</p>

    <p>“I shock your good old Puritan soul, I see. Nothing
        shocks me. God made all, and there is no high nor
        low—that’s my simple creed. And don’t forget that
        in biology man is not different from the rest of creation;
        we are only <i>vertebrata</i>, my good friend, subject all to
        the same law of life; biology knows no Chosen Species.
        Good night, old Allen.... I am sorry we did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
        have this talk earlier. I am not strong for self-sacrifice,
        but, really, I believe, if I had known, I—well, I
        would not have let things go so far.”</p>

    <p>Blynn looked hard at him, in his eyes the fire of a
        zealot.</p>

    <p>“Things have—have—gone far; have they?”</p>

    <p>“Quite,” said Leopold. “Quite far.”</p>

    <p>After that night Blynn withdrew abruptly from the
        daily councils at “Top-o’-the-Hill.” The preparation
        of the lectures seemed to be taking all his time. He
        dropped in on the group once or twice for a moment’s
        chat, and to see the progress, but his mind seemed ever
        hard at work, selecting and rejecting material. That
        series must be a great go, he explained; he would put
        his best into it, and give them the worth of their money.
        In two weeks he was off to Rochester.</p>
    <hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

    <div class="chapter">
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>

        <h3 class="nobreak">XXVII<br>

            TZOO-OOM!</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">WHEN Allen left for his lecture tour, Gorgas
        immediately knocked off work and gave herself
        up to gloomy thoughts. She began to
        discover what a lonely child she had always been; she
        who had had parents, but no real mother and father;
        and now <i>mon capitaine</i> (<i>mon duc, mon prince!</i>) was
        busy with his own affairs. Bardek, too, had been in the
        depths—it was Leopold’s doleful song that had set
        him off. “One should not sing of ‘For-r-ty year-r
        on,’” he growled, “not when one is for-r-ty year-r
        on!” The “smitty” was therefore deserted. And
        Leopold had been absolutely debarred from the Leverings;
        Gorgas would send for him when she wanted him.</p>

    <p>There comes a night when lights go up in Bardek’s
        “white-wash house.” Gorgas is gloomily swinging in
        a hammock in the orchard. She listens to the clatter
        and to the singing, and knows that Bardek has recovered
        his spirits. Are they dancing? She can hear
        the thump of the children’s heavy shoes, and she can
        see forms flash back and forth between the light and
        the window. Bardek’s voice is roaring; and an occasional
        squeal from the inexpressive little wife is a certain
        sign of good times.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>Hey ho! She, too, could be happy if she chose. Off
        there in the dark, Leopold was waiting; waiting with
        fearful, confident patience, she thought and shuddered.
        If she chose—but she could not will to choose. Not
        yet, at any rate; she would wait a while.</p>

    <p>After a time the noise subsided in Bardek’s cottage.
        The lamp moved into the kitchen, and finally it travelled
        up the stairs and into the children’s room. It was the
        putting-to-bed hour, a happy sky-larking time in the
        Bardek household.</p>

    <p>So much happiness near at hand was almost too much
        for Gorgas. The shrill voices of the children especially
        were painful as they came clear on the night air; it
        made her feel more motherless and deserted than is
        quite bearable. She turned her back to the joyous
        windows and strove fiercely to keep down the desire to
        give way to tears. But they would come; little trickling
        ones first; then huge, coursing ones; and, finally, a
        very deluge.</p>

    <p>The man who had been her “lord and master” all
        her life—all the life that counted—had gone gravely
        away without so much as a smiling goodby. For days
        she had been watching him hungrily as he talked with
        seriousness—to everybody but to her—of his dates,
        cities, halls, subjects; and she could glean nothing from
        his sober face but an alarming interest in lectures. All
        her life she had given him the first place in her heart
        and was content; with an absurd faith, as the days of
        her childhood flitted by, that all would surely be right
        in the end; and now she was telling herself that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
        been deceived by a dream. He was not for her; to him
        she was a child, an interesting child, to be sure, capable
        in many ways above other children, but only one of a
        hundred or more of his “cases,” one which he had probably
        card-catalogued under the “L’s,” with penciled
        notes—a pedagogic specimen!</p>

    <p>It was hateful, and she cried aloud her protest; it
        was unfair; and it was not to be endured. But even
        as she protested wildly in the dark of the orchard, she
        felt the pitiless certainty of the facts; for once more
        she had written him a letter—to be sure, it was only
        a funny little request for an “interview with the great
        man,” written under his very nose, and put in his own
        hand to mail; with characteristic disregard of her he
        had posted the letter without once looking at it—and
        he had neglected to answer it.</p>

    <p>On the day before he left Mount Airy, she had seen
        the small gray note among a bundle that he had sorted
        out in public; and the sight of it had sent her face flaming,
        as if it would shout its contents to all the world;
        but he had given it one frowning stare and passed it
        over without a touch of recognition, so intent was he
        on his own affairs.</p>

    <p>No better proof, she thought, of the gulf that separated
        them. Morris had taught her to be a “sport,”
        and all her instinct bade her bear without flinching.
        She would face the facts, be they or be they not to her
        hurt—but, oh, the bitterness of the reality. Her
        childhood’s dream was far better, picturing something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
        always off in the future, always a possible event....
        If—</p>

    <p>No. His face was “on the outside” as Bardek had
        said; and during those last few days could there be any
        mistaking of the calm, self-absorbed Allen? If it had
        been hers to choose, would she have elected a public
        lecture tour as against the partner of her soul?</p>

    <p>Oh, no! Though Boston and New York and all the
        cities of Christendom called in dulcet tones! Oh, no!</p>

    <p>The lamp had come down in the Bardek house. In
        the Levering home a low light burned in the library.
        Her mother and father were there, she knew; but the
        thought of meeting them and talking of everyday matters
        was too repellent. How far away they were from
        her now, and always had been! And how much, just
        now, she needed the comfort of communion. She gazed
        wistfully at Bardek’s gay light. His great laugh came
        through the trees and cheered her wonderfully. Dear
        old Bardek, mother and sister and father-confessor, all
        rolled into one! She would go to Bardek and lay her
        little troubles in his huge palm.</p>

    <p>The Bardek house was without corridors. One
        opened the front door and stood within. And who
        would dream of knocking at that democratic portal!
        So she slipped noiselessly along the grass, which grew
        to the very edge of the house, turned the knob quietly
        and entered.</p>

    <p>Bardek was facing her, standing like a statue in the
        middle of the low room. The light was behind him, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
        that Gorgas, coming in out of the darkness, was not
        able instantly to comprehend that the little wife, clad
        in the gayest of garments, deep reds and greens, with
        a glorious scarf of gold about her head, was folded
        snugly in the Bohemian’s sturdy arms.</p>

    <p>“Oh!” cried Gorgas, and started back.</p>

    <p>“Come in!” welcomed Bardek, without moving the
        fraction of an inch, save the necessary tightening of his
        hold on the shy wife.</p>

    <p>“Oh, no! No!” cried Gorgas, shocked at her intrusion.</p>

    <p>“Come in, I say!” roared Bardek. “We jus’ celebr-r-rate
        our marriage—zat is all. Come in, and see
        how it is done.... Be still, Bit-of-my-heart,” he
        called to the struggling wife, but in some staccato dialect
        of Hungary. “We must be the teacher of the
        beautiful Gorgas in all things, and this is what she
        should learn to do; and it must be done well, or life
        itself is spilled to the wind.” This he translated gayly
        to Gorgas. “Come in, <i>Liebschen</i>! This is our marriage
        day. It is the day I take the wonderful woman
        when she is but wonderful girl, take her right out of the
        street where she squat beside the orange cart wit’ her
        peddling mother; and I do not know her name; and I
        will not know it, so I can call her love names all her
        life—I take her from her oranges, and quick into the
        biggest cathedral in all Hungary, and kneel before the
        altar, and call upon the priest to come marry us before
        I cut him open to see what make him so fat and slow.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>The invitation in their eyes was so real that Gorgas
        slipped weakly to a chair near the door.</p>

    <p>“He say to wait five, six, seven week or it not a marriage,”
        Bardek went on. “‘Five, six, seven week!’ I
        cry; ‘in that time she be grow up and ol’ woman! And
        I? Every day of zose week I die of waiting. Five,
        six, seven week? Not five, six, seven minute!’; and I
        scare zat priest by the things I say. And when I show
        him gold, he not so scared, but raise up the hands and
        make the language which I give him to make.</p>

    <p>“And when all is done, ‘<i>Tzoom!</i>’ I cry, and explain:
        ‘Zat is the big bell up in Heaven which bring all the
        angels to the Gates of Earth, through which they now
        look down; and <i>Tzoo-oom!</i>’—he nearly drop dead for
        think I be madman!—‘zat is the bell which break open
        the Gates of Earth and fling the glad angels toward
        this good world of love; and <i>Tzoo-oo-oom!</i>’ I roar like
        the roar of Saint Peters in Rome when they make the
        new Pope, ‘<i>zat</i> is the bell which make this woman <i>of</i>
        my blood and <i>of</i> my flesh, and carry us together, up
        straight up, up, up with the singing angels to the
        Heaven itself.’ And zen I take her in my arms, and
        lift her to her little toes, and hug her till she forget for
        little while to live!... Ah! But she nevair forget
        <i>zat</i> marriage! Nevair!”
    </p>

    <p>As he talked he interrupted himself often to utter
        weird sayings to the happy wife, so that she half turned
        in his arms, and seemed to understand that he was telling
        Gorgas of the wonderful wedding day. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
        Gorgas contemplated their happiness with the greatest
        sympathy and with a longing that was akin to pain.</p>

    <p>“So!” Bardek went on jubilantly. “On zat wonderful
        day in May, which we now celebr-r-ate—ah.
        May is in Hungary of all months the—”</p>

    <p>“But Bardek,” Gorgas interrupted, for a moment
        forgetting her personal grief. “This is not May, it
        is September.” She could not be mistaken about this,
        for in three days it would be the tenth, her birthday,
        and Allen had promised her a mysterious gift on that
        day.</p>

    <p>“Of course!” smiled Bardek. “So we celebr-r-ate
        our marriage.”</p>

    <p>“But if it was May when you—”</p>

    <p>“You would wait until it come May again?” he
        inquired mildly.</p>

    <p>By this time he had sat himself in a big chair, and
        the wife had dropped to the floor, draping herself about
        his knee. The scarf of gold spread out in a brilliant
        streamer; the greens and reds of her Hungarian costume
        tumbled over one another in a riot of unpremeditated
        folds. The blood was afire in her gypsy face,
        and her eyes were two dark lights. By the magic of
        adoration this peasant woman was transformed into a
        thing of rare delight.</p>

    <p>“But if you were married in May,” Gorgas was saying,
        “you could not have an anniversary until—”</p>

    <p>“Ho!” cried Bardek in great glee, and then communicated
        exultant things to the gay wife, patting her
        on the head the while, and tweaking her brown ears.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
        “Ho!” he turned to Gorgas. “You would wait until
        it come May again! You are like the priest who I
        scare all the Latin out of! You would wait five, six,
        seven week! You would wait until the earth go about
        the sun just <i>so</i>!—until the constellations of the heavens
        be just <i>so</i>! You cannot praise God until it be
        Sunday; you cannot be married when Nature cries out
        it is time, and you would let the calendar make you
        slave when you would have anniversary! Ho! It is
        superstitious you are! Sometimes I have celebr-r-ated
        zat marriage three times in one month! Here is my
        calendar of days!” he slapped his heart right lustily.</p>

    <p>“Many things might make me celebr-r-ate,” he went
        on. “This time it was your Leopold and his ugly
        song. ‘For-r-ty year-r on, when afar-r and asunder-r,’”
        he rolled his r’s vigorously. “It is a song
        that give me the blue devils of regret. ‘For-r-ty
        year-r on!’ it is no song to sing, when it is I, Bardek,
        who is ‘for-r-ty year-r on,’ and do not want to remember
        zat it is so! ‘For-r-ty year-r on!’ Heugh! It
        is a ol’ man’s song; and I must sing it over and over in
        my brain, till I cannot work, and grow sick wit’
        thoughts of gray head and teeth falling out, and feel
        my bones go stiff, and—heugh! So I be ol’ man for
        two, three day, and zen I make celebr-r-ation and chase
        the bad thoughts out. To this little Bit-of-my-heart I
        say, ‘Quick, get into the beautiful clothes of Hungary,
        put on the scarf of gold, and the earrings and the
        spangles of gold, and we will have again our marriage
        day! <i>Tzoo-oom!</i>’” he boomed suddenly, and caressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
        the lady’s head with huge confidence. “And
        now I am young again!”</p>

    <p>Even though he had seemed so absorbed in his own
        contemplations, Bardek’s quick eye had noted the droop
        in Gorgas’ shoulders, and the discouraging sadness in
        her mien.</p>

    <p>“Zat song?” he asked her; “it make ugly thoughts
        for you, too; eh, my Gorgas?”</p>

    <p>She tried to speak, but found it easier to shake her
        head. No; it was not the song that had taken the
        spring out of her life.</p>

    <p>“U-m!” hummed Bardek sympathetically. And
        then, with characteristic abruptness, he asked, “When
        is it zat you go to the priest and make the bells of
        Heaven go, <i>tzoom!</i>—eh?”</p>

    <p>This was too much for Gorgas. It brought with
        benumbing clearness the vision of her own forlorn place
        in the world. There would be for her no exulting Bardek
        to seize her out of the street beside her cart of
        oranges, carry her to the nearest altar, and start the
        very heavens a-tzooming for joy. But she was too
        brave a lass to weep in the presence of Bardek and his
        lady, although it was a glistening eye and a trembling
        lip which smiled gamely at them.</p>

    <p>“Leopold—” she began, but words were too difficult;
        so she stopped pathetically, and seemed to beg
        Bardek to understand.</p>

    <p>“H-m,” said he. “Leopold, eh?... He is very
        wonderful man.... Very smart.... He know—everything.”
        Bardek spread out his palms humbly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
        “You would celebr-r-ate wit’ Leopold, eh?” He
        watched her narrowly, but she did not answer. “Of
        course, you would know. You would not have to look
        in a book for to find out <i>zat</i>—or to ask the mother
        if it be so!... You would know.... And it is very
        important to know; for if you do not know whether
        you will want to smash the calendar and have two, three
        celebr-r-ation in one month, and all the times after
        which you do live together,” he spread his palms a
        trifle higher, “well, zen you should not begin—much
        better to die.... So it is Leopold, eh?”</p>

    <p>“No!” she struggled to her feet. “No, Bardek,
        it is not Leopold. He wants me, but I won’t have him.
        I won’t! He frightens me, and always did, from the
        time he began to watch me, like a big, big—” She
        could not find the word. “It is not Leopold!”</p>

    <p>Bardek’s sudden laugh drew her out of her tragic
        plane, and in some inexplicable way gave her a touch
        of gladness.</p>

    <p>“I <i>know</i> zat it is not Leopold!” he cried. “I could
        see it in your two eyes zat it is not! And I could see
        it in your two eyes who zat it is! Ah! Your eyes
        zey tell me whenever you do look at him!... And zat
        is <i>so</i> right now! <i>So</i> right!...”</p>

    <p>His own two eyes beamed and sparkled upon her, and
        seemed to shout congratulations, and many happy returns
        of the day. To his wife he confided uproariously;
        so clearly, indeed, that Gorgas understood every word
        and gesture; and as he mounted to Hungarian eloquence,
        she began to catch some of the contagion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
        his confidence: the despairing thoughts born of reality
        began to clear out, vanish like a cloud rack before the
        west wind; and she revived her spirits with the vitality
        of Bardek’s optimism.</p>

    <p>At his call she came over and sat down on the floor
        beside the wife, Bardek presiding above them like a
        patriarch of old. And the wife, so often smilingly
        mute in that household, broke forth in a musical chirping
        of congratulations, and stroked Gorgas’ hair, and
        patted her cheek, and welcomed her to the inner shrine
        of spouses! To Gorgas it was a very blessed ordination.
        For a little while she would pretend, she defended
        herself, and then—</p>

    <p>But Bardek was in full flow: “With him, with the
        good Allen, you would celebr-r-ate; eh, <i>mein Liebschen,
            ma fleur du bois?</i> Marriage? Ho! Zat is easy to
        do—it take five, six week; or it take five, six minute—but
        to celebr-r-ate, it must last all the life! There are
        many peoples who have had just marriage, with confetti,
        and bands and dancing and much wine, but zey
        will never, never celebr-r-ate! Ho! It would be comic
        to see zem even to try! Comic? It would be pain!...
        For to celebr-r-ate, it is to be two peoples wit’
        body and bone and blood of one—See!—ze blood it
        go up my arm, and through my aor-r-ta, and <i>presto!</i>
        it is humming along zis little woman’s pink ear and
        making the eyes to dance! And ze daughter of ze
        peddling mother must in dose times rise to be ze queen
        of all ze wor-r-ld—<i>regina dei gratia et potentissima et
            pulchrissima!</i>... Look at her, <i>mein Liebschen</i>. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
        you she is, I know not what strange child of Europa—”</p>

    <p>“She is beautiful!” murmured Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“Ah! I make you see a little wit’ my eyes,” his voice
        grew tender; “but you do not know. Even you, my
        Gorgas, are as nothing to her. You are good—<i>mais
            oui!</i>—but I would not walk wit’ you one, two, t’ree
        step when <i>she</i> crook the finger and smile, ‘<i>Come!</i>’”</p>

    <p>All this was very wonderful to Gorgas, this most intimate
        revelation of the deep privacy of domestic happiness;
        and because she believed that it was the true state
        of all right marriages, she reveled in its beauty; and
        then she shivered at the stark reality that was hers.
        For her there would be no “celebrations.”</p>

    <p>But she would not give way again. “That’s all
        very pretty and poetic, Bardek,” she sat up straight,
        and seemed to fling off the romantic spell which the
        Bohemian had set vibrating. “I’m better now. Had
        a good cry out there,” she jabbed a hand toward the
        orchard. “Lonesome, I guess. Came in here to get
        cheered up—and you did it! Sure did!” She
        searched the room with wondering eyes, as if trying
        to comprehend how a hut like this could be so charged
        with happiness. “But I’m different, Bardek.” That
        was her own answer to the survey she had just made.
        “I wanted something ... and wanted it ... more—well!
        why talk about it—” With a great effort
        she controlled a quavering voice. “I am not to have
        it—that’s all.”</p>

    <p>Bardek watched her with deep sympathy. All the
        time, he stroked the head of the gypsy girl at his knee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
        and seemed to agree with Gorgas. But to himself he
        said, as he admitted later, “She must suffer first, because
        it is the demand of love that we suffer; in no
        other way can we give it its true value; and then she
        will believe better when she has plumbed the depths of
        doubt.”</p>

    <p>She got a grip on herself and went on: “I must
        not fool myself any longer.... It is madness....
        I’d soon be fit for nothing.... Leopold is all right.
        I’ve known him all my life. He likes me, and, in a
        way, I like him. We have had great times together.
        I’ll get over the shock of his liking me in the way—in
        the way he does.... Got sort of used to it already.
        I told him I’d let him know. He’s waiting. He said
        I didn’t know myself ... that I’d come to him ...
        ‘like the tides rise and follow the irresistible moon,’
        he said.... I guess he was right.... He knows a
        lot about me! It seems a little bit unfair, but I suppose— Suppose,
        nothing!” She got herself up
        suddenly from the comfortable floor, and, at the motion,
        seemed to bring her resolutions together. “I
        can’t stand this any longer,” she turned to Bardek.
        “Leopold it is and must be—I’d better get used to
        it—and all I’ve got to do is to walk down that road
        twenty steps and whistle.”</p>

    <p>She moved resolutely toward the door. “There is
        one way to settle it once and for all,” she said, “a sure
        way to end all the suffering which comes of uncertainty—and
        it is better,” she insisted, “to stop forever
        the doubt and the pain.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>“Twenty paces down the road,” thought Bardek.
        “Why, then it would be all over for the little Gorgas,
        and settled for life—like two puffs of a cigarette!”</p>

    <p>Her hand was on the knob before Bardek called
        softly to her.</p>

    <p>“Yes, Bardek?” she asked, for he had not spoken
        more than her name. She looked magnificently strong
        and able as she stood blocked out in dark tints against
        his white door; and the weariness and the despondency
        had gone from her; wavering uncertainty had
        made place for the mind made up. She could not have
        her first wish; very well; she would accept the next
        best, and it would not be done half-heartedly; and
        once accepted, she would be loyal to the death. All
        this Bardek noted as he looked at her.</p>

    <p>“But it is another story zat I happen to know,”
        he began softly. “Allen Blynn has not told me in
        words, for then I could not speak wit’out being tattle-tale,
        but I have listened wit’ my eyes and wit’ my heart—oh,
        a very good ear my heart has!—and so I know
        zat it is the good Allen who prays on his knees every
        night zat some day he will have courage to ask my
        Gorgas to try to like him—jus’ a leetle bit, mebbe!”</p>

    <p>Slowly he drew her from the door. She protested.
        He argued subtly—it was the fight, he said, against
        the Evil One for the life of a woman, so it needs must
        be subtle. Slowly he drew her again to her place beside
        him on the floor. And then he poured forth the
        eloquence that only Bardek could summon. He made
        her cry and he made her laugh; and he filled her with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
        hope. Who could doubt Bardek when he rose to his
        best? And when the theme is Love—ah! Bardek
        could have made great strides toward converting the
        Evil One himself!</p>

    <p>“But how do you know, Bardek?” Gorgas demanded.</p>

    <p>Ah, he knew! He, Bardek, had been born with both
        of his two eyes open! The ways of Allen Blynn were
        not hidden from him. And the little Gorgas must not
        let despair and fear in at the heart, for they are the
        father and mother of failure. Much he told her of
        Allen, evidence that piled up against the absent swain,
        until some of the despair and fear fled at his strong
        touch. The protestings of Gorgas grew weaker as
        Bardek plied his argument.</p>

    <p>Among other matters he related one of the many
        debates which he and Allen had had together. Blynn
        had been standing for a reaction against the type of
        freedom—free will, free love, free anything—which
        had been pulsing from the “lunacy fringe” of the radicals
        for a generation or more. “They do not seem
        to understand,” Blynn had argued, “that there is
        something higher than individual will—or even the individual
        nation’s will, as Alexander and Napoleon have
        long ago found out—something which demands surrender,
        acquiescence.” Bardek had been defending life
        as the expression of the individual right to live; Blynn
        had taken the side of individual renunciation. “But
        there <i>is</i> a divine, far-off event to which the whole creation<span class="pagenum"
            id="Page_383">[383]</span>
        moves,” said Blynn; “and while our irresistible
        part is that of free spirits, yet we are most free when
        we bind the law upon ourselves.” That was the philosophy
        of Allen Blynn.</p>

    <p>“He is not one to seize the daughter of the orange
        woman,” laughed Bardek, “and zen make a new service
        of marriage for himself! Ho! He would beat his
        breast wit’ ze big stone and wait four, five, six week!
        Now you! You are like me—it make you sick to
        wait. So! I say, do not wait. Go to him. Tell him
        to hurry. Tell him you cannot wait for God’s big
        universe to come to end, but it must come now! Go
        to him, <i>Liebschen</i>! Go to him!”</p>

    <p>“I have always wanted to,” agreed Gorgas. “Many
        times I started to—but I was afraid.”</p>

    <p>“Afraid of what?” asked the fearless man.</p>

    <p>“Women do not do that, Bardek.”</p>

    <p>He raged at her. “How often have I taught you
        not to be afraid of what women do or do not! It is
        woman who will be the last slave on the free earth; and
        it is because she <i>want</i> to be slave. I will not have you,
        my Gorgas, be like all ze others! Go, and <i>be</i>!”</p>

    <p>“But he is in Boston,” she faltered. She knew his
        itinerary by heart.</p>

    <p>“Go to him, <i>ma fleurie</i>. Lives have been lost
        through pride, through not saying the word when it
        is time. Boston is not yet Babylon, but for you, <i>mein
            Liebschen</i>, there it is zat ze tower to Heaven is. Go to
        him.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>“I know just what I shall say,” she laughed. The
        natural tint of health was back in her face. “I have
        said it so often to myself.”</p>

    <p>“Of course you have!” he agreed heartily. “And
        you will say it over again for many years. And the
        speeches he will say to you! <i>Himmel!</i> <i>What</i> a dam
        will burst and drown all the little valleys when one
        of zese Puritans go loose! Zey try hard all the life to
        live like Saint Acetum, the Vinegar Saint who is always
        repairing ze roof of ze Heaven; and when zey
        topple over and fall, it is a great distance!... You
        will be eaten alive, my Gorgas; and it is a very pleasant
        experience, vairy pleasant and good!”</p>

    <p>And that night a happy, exulting young woman,
        charged with uncalculable joy, strode across the lawn
        and through the orchard, with never a fear nor a despair,
        those sad parents of failure.</p>

        <h3 class="nobreak">XXVIII<br>

            THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap2">AT Boston Allen Blynn was preparing to loaf
        about the old town at his ease until the door
        should open for his second lecture in that
        city. At eleven o’clock he was on his knees at the bed;
        he could not quite make up his mind which was the
        easiest pair of shoes for walking.</p>

    <p>A knock at his door, the deferential tap of a well-feed
        “bell-hop” brought his cheery, “Come!” but he
        did not look around.</p>

    <p>“Good morning, Professor,” greeted Gorgas, fresh
        and radiant.</p>

    <p>“Gracious!” ejaculated the astonished Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Don’t let me interrupt your rosary,” she laughed.</p>

    <p>He jumped to his feet—still unadorned with shoes—and
        grasped both her extended hands.</p>

    <p>“Well! Well!” he looked at her from several angles.
        “If this doesn’t beat the Pennsylvania-Dutch!
        How did you get here? Another ‘bee-line,’ eh? By
        the Great Horn Spoon, I’m glad to see you! Did the
        whole family come up? Where is Kate?” he made a
        motion as if to look into the hall, but quickly gave up
        because of the more overpowering desire to gaze at
        his entrancing visitor. “And how did you know I was
        here?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>“Hold on!” she stopped him. “This is no blooming
        quiz. I’m alone, <i>mon capitaine</i>. I just—came.”</p>

    <p>His mind would not quite focus on the fact.</p>

    <p>“I see!” he managed to say, but he did not see.</p>

    <p>She produced a cardboard. “Thought I’d boost
        your little lecture by buying a ticket,” she explained.</p>

    <p>“Alone!” he exclaimed. “When did you come?”</p>

    <p>“On the Federal express, night before last. I mixed
        up your dates. Thought you were due in Boston yesterday.
        So I just naturally waited over.” She
        walked toward the window. “Great view you have
        here; simply great!” He seized the nearest pair of
        shoes and struggled into them. Then he followed her
        to the window.</p>

    <p>“Does Mrs. Levering know you have come?” he
        asked, full of the proprieties.</p>

    <p>She sang a bar of a popular hit.</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
            <div class="first">“Do you know what you’re about?</div>
            <div class="verse">Does your mother know you’re out?</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“I didn’t say exactly where I was going; I don’t
        think I did,” she turned reflectively. “Why should I?”</p>

    <p>He tried to explain. She was still a child, seventeen
        years old, he told her.</p>

    <p>“I’m eighteen the tenth of this month, and that’s
        tomorrow,” she corrected.</p>

    <p>He knew that. Still—he argued further.</p>

    <p>“Why <i>will</i> you persist in looking down on me?”
        she stamped her foot, just like a child. “I’ve been
        on my own since I was knee high to a grasshopper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
        I’m making my own living; I do a man’s work and, by
        your own Horn Spoon, I can take care of myself.
        Look here: yesterday afternoon I sunned myself in the
        Common on a bench—”</p>

    <p>“Heavens!” he muttered.</p>

    <p>“You should use just the opposite word,” she commented
        complacently. “I just sat there and counted
        the men who ogled me and the ones who sat down and
        tried to talk.”</p>

    <p>“Goodness!” said he.</p>

    <p>“Opposite again,” she corrected. “They were just
        imps. Well, they didn’t waste much time on me, I tell
        you! Superior disdain, that’s the trick.”</p>

    <p>The professor was flabbergasted. He told her so,
        and tried to make clear the risks she was running.</p>

    <p>She laughed at him. “Now don’t be preachy, Allen
        Blynn; I’m in Boston to get ideas from the Jewelers’
        Exposition—that, among other things. I’m a business
        woman, you know. It’s a new species; get used
        to it.”</p>

    <p>The Jewelers’ Exposition was a discovery of the day
        before. It would not do to be too abrupt with Allen
        Blynn.</p>

    <p>By the time he had gone with her to the Exposition
        and had heard her wise talk to the exhibitors, he was
        almost used to it; and by the time he had watched her
        taking notes and making sketches, he was quite reconciled.
        Then they just prowled.</p>

    <p>“Let’s go window-cracking?” she suggested.</p>

    <p>“Not for a minute!” he pretended alarm.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>“Don’t you know ‘window-cracking’?” she looked
        incredulously. “Where <i>is</i> your knowledge of English?
        That’s my private word for looking in every
        window along one street and picking out the things
        you would buy, and not buying a thing. It’s great
        fun, and awfully cheap.”</p>

    <p>So they went “window-cracking,” like penniless children.</p>

    <p>They lunched in style at the best hotel and lived
        many weeks together in one afternoon. She gave him
        time to get his notes together for the lecture, drove
        with him to the hall and sat in the middle of the
        audience, an enraptured vision to stir him to his
        best.</p>

    <p>At the close of the lecture he hurried to her.</p>

    <p>“I have a surprise for you,” he whispered; “you
        are not the only lady that takes long journeys to help
        out struggling lecturers. I want you to meet ‘The
        Lady of the Interruption.’”</p>

    <p>Her glance fell. “I hate her,” she said.</p>

    <p>“S-sh!” he smiled and turned to a gracious matronly
        woman of about fifty-five.</p>

    <p>“Mrs. Fellows, here’s my little girl, Gorgas,” he
        said.</p>

    <p>“No longer a little girl,” Mrs. Fellows extended a
        hand.</p>

    <p>“You are the ‘Lady’?” Gorgas gasped.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” the “Lady” responded pleasantly. “You
        thought I was young and attractive, and you are happy
        to find I am not.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>“But you <i>are</i> attractive—you are lovely!” Gorgas
        shot out impulsively.</p>

    <p>“Ah! thank you,” the Lady bowed herself away;
        “that is a nice speech. And I know you think you
        mean it.”</p>

    <p>She was gone and others crowded around.</p>

    <p>“Why didn’t you tell me she was old?” Gorgas inquired.</p>

    <p>“It was a stupid joke of mine not to,” he replied
        as they struggled through the crowd. “I found her
        out long ago. She has had great troubles—death in
        a very frightful form. She has considerable wealth
        but gives her whole life to charity. Eccentric, a little;
        but her mind is mighty keen, I can tell you. I
        am very fond of her; that is why I did not like to discuss
        her with anyone after I found out.”</p>

    <p>At half-past ten they were having supper in a gaudy
        grill-room, thrilling with the strumming of an Hungarian
        “orchestra” and the stirring air of city-bohemias.</p>

    <p>Then Allen Blynn came partly to his senses.
        “You’re going home tonight,” he said firmly.</p>

    <p>“On the ‘Midnight,’” she agreed, and displayed her
        Pullman ticket.</p>

    <p>“Good!” he exclaimed, relieved. “I’m half responsible,
        you know,” he added. “It’s a great lark.
        I’m just chuck full of joy; but we must ship you off
        tonight.”</p>

    <p>“Let’s quarrel a little bit, first,” she smiled. “We
        have had some dandy quarrels, haven’t we?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>He couldn’t remember any; then she would start one.</p>

    <p>“First,” she began, “I want to know why you didn’t
        walk home with me the night of the picnic at Top-o’-the-Hill—when
        Leopold sang ‘Forty year on.’ I
        wrote you a little note asking you to go with me.
        You trotted off with Kate and left me with Leopold.
        We had the deuce of a time, I can tell you.”</p>

    <p>Conscience-stricken, he remembered that half-read
        letter. The offer of the lectures had swamped his
        mind.</p>

    <p>The explanation satisfied.</p>

    <p>“Leopold wants to marry me,” she blurted out
        next.</p>

    <p>“I know,” he replied gravely. “He told me as
        much,—but at seventeen! Think of it!”</p>

    <p>“I wish you would not always be telling me that I
        am—” she began indignantly.</p>

    <p>“But you are, you know,” he told her quietly.
        “Leopold is as old as I, but a man couldn’t possib—”</p>

    <p>“Oh,” she laughed. “He couldn’t? <i>Couldn’t</i> he!
        He’s been dogging me for ever so long. You make a
        big mistake about years. Everybody does. At thirteen,
        when I first talked with you, I was as much a
        woman as I am now or ever will be. And I’ve been
        sitting back trying to behave myself like a doll. At
        fifteen I had my height and—everything; and now I’m
        eighteen. I can’t stay in the refrigerator any longer,
        I tell you.... Leopold? Child? Let me tell you
        something, Allen Blynn. Leopold and I had a fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
        that night. Not words, remember; but an ugly real
        fight, with fists and hands.... He knows I’m no
        child.... Now wait!” she held up her hand. “Leopold’s
        all right. He wants to marry me. He did just
        what he ought to have done. It was all right, absolutely
        right. It was my fault again. You went off
        and deserted me—and I just didn’t care what happened
        to me. Then I had to fight my way out. <i>Nom
            d’une pipe! Nom du nom d’une pipe!</i>... And that
        isn’t all. I must shock your old professorial head a
        little. There was another.... But I woke up and
        got out. Your letter did it—the one on morals and
        instincts, and that terrible story of the leper; don’t you
        remember?”</p>

    <p>Yes, he remembered. The little woman before him
        was opening up astonishing vistas into her stirring
        life. But she was a child, he insisted. The general
        appearance was that of a woman; but that was a trick
        of hat and gown and hair, a disguise easily seen through.
        Her face was womanly, and her voice; but in both
        were cries of very young life. Her very wonderful
        health, the thing that gave her beauty—that was
        youth; and her frankness was the innocence of youth.</p>

    <p>“Do you know what Bardek means by Saint Acetum?”
        she asked him suddenly. She had been studying
        his rather solemn-smiling face, delighting in its
        fine seriousness—made fine, she thought, by the light
        of a smile that hovered ever in the eyes and in and
        out the firm lips.</p>

    <p>“What does Bardek mean by anything!” Allen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
        chuckled contentedly, the solemnity quite fading from
        his face at the thought of the unfathomable Bardek.
        “Saint Acetum? I never heard of the person.”</p>

    <p>“Oh!” Gorgas laughed in her impulsive way.
        “Saint Acetum is you!—The Vinegar Saint! Oh,
        Allen Blynn, that is <i>too</i> funny!...” Allen frowned
        at her inquiringly. “That’s just the way he would
        look, too—stern, and wise, and worried—”</p>

    <p>“Worried?”</p>

    <p>“For fear the roof would fall in, you know.”</p>

    <p>“Roof?” he glanced apprehensively at the ceiling.</p>

    <p>“Saint Acetum, you know—” she tried to explain.
        His serious face was delightfully comic; in a
        flash she saw how it would be immensely jolly, and assuring,
        to have him gazing at her forever as if she
        needed the firmest and sternest looking after.</p>

    <p>“Saint Acetum?” he cogitated. “There ain’t no
        such animal.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes,” she continued, “Bardek says—”</p>

    <p>“Bardek invented him, then.”</p>

    <p>“Of <i>course</i>, silly! That’s the fun of it. Saint
        Acetum is forever repairing ‘ze roof of ze Heaven’;
        and there he is up there all alone, patching and patching,
        and always looking for trouble; and he won’t <i>ever</i>
        come down and have a good time with the angels—not
        even once! It might rain, you see. And Bardek says,
        that’s just like you, Allen Blynn—”</p>

    <p>“Isn’t Bardek a wonder!” His eyes glowed with
        delight in the Bohemian’s comic fantasy. “And isn’t
        that just like him!... The Vinegar Saint!...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
        Well!...” A strong flash of determination came
        into his face suddenly. “And he is quite right!...
        <i>Someone</i> must keep watch lest the Heavens fall! And
        they might fall, you know,” he added whimsically.
        “You believe that God is good, and all-wise, and all-powerful,
        don’t you?”
    </p>

    <p>She nodded. “One must,” she said. “It would be
        terrible not to.”</p>

    <p>“He is good, and wise; but perhaps not all-wise.
        And sometimes I think He is not all-powerful. The
        Old One has won some of the battles—in Eden, for instance.
        Sometimes I fancy—it is an ancient belief—that
        the long battle between Good and Evil, begun
        aeons ago in chaos, is still at its height, and that the
        outcome might even be in doubt; and then I fancy that
        He needs us—some of us—on the firing line; or, like
        your Vinegar Saint, guarding the outposts. Perhaps
        we are sometimes a brake on progress, but often we
        are the ones who save liberty from liberty’s self. You
        know, we Allens were Tories in the Revolution; we
        were for the existing order then, and against the revolutionists.
        There must be a drop or two of reactionary
        blood still in me!... Vinegar Saint! Good!
        But don’t think that the poor old chap loves the endless
        patching, or that the songs of the angels don’t
        tempt him mightily to shirk his job.... And if he gets
        to looking too fierce and vinegary, it’s because—”</p>

    <p>“It’s because he is a dear old honest <i>capitaine</i>,” she
        cried; “and I’d rather have him vinegary any day
        than—”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>“Peppery?” he joked, determined not to be solemn.</p>

    <p>“Yes, or even sugary. Ugh!” she affected a delightful
        shudder. “How I hate the sweety ones!”</p>

    <p>This was a pleasing savor to the Vinegar Saint, and
        for a moment or two he forgot his patchings, and
        reveled in the unsaintly joy of flattery; then he remembered
        abruptly.</p>

    <p>“What are you going to do about Leopold?” he
        asked.</p>

    <p>“It depends upon you, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” she replied
        calmly. “If you don’t want me, Allen Blynn—<i>anybody</i>
        can have me. There! It’s out! I’ve made up
        my mind to say this to you for almost a year. Let
        me—”</p>

    <p>A preposterous waiter had to be dealt with. He was
        recommending some custard concoction with a dash
        of white wine, and inquiring about such irrelevant matters
        as demi-tasses or full cups. Gorgas had to be
        appealed to. She made selections deliberately, but her
        fingers were nervously restless.</p>

    <p>“So you will take the wine-sauce?” the waiter was
        most interested.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” said Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Or would you prefer it with cream?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” said Blynn.</p>

    <p>“Perhaps M’sieu’ would rather have the sliced
        oranges?”</p>

    <p>“Yes, yes,” said Blynn in great distress, “Anything,
        old man. You fix it up. Anything. Just cut
        along like a good fellow, will you?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>“Don’t look so frowning, <i>mon capitaine</i>,” Gorgas
        smiled across the table, but her eyes belied that smile.
        “Don’t speak yet. Let me show you how I look at
        this thing. If I stop now, I’ll never begin again.
        And I just can’t stand keeping it inside.... When
        you came to me at the tennis-court five years ago and
        took me for a grown woman, the thing was done; right
        there. I’ve never got over it. I’ve tried; but it was
        no use; it got worse. I sent you to Holden to get rid
        of you.... You scared me.... You saw it, I guess.
        My eyes must have shown, for you got out of the
        way.... That’s why you suddenly fled to Holden;
        wasn’t it?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” dumbly.</p>

    <p>“I knew.... It was beastly the way you cut
        me.... Don’t speak yet.... I don’t blame you....
        Sometimes I’d catch you looking at me like
        a hungry dog, afraid to come near for fear I’d
        beat you or something. I know what was the matter.
        You were afraid of encouraging a child. Mercy!
        Encourage? That was just the way to make me
        rabid! Well, I resolved to grow up. I fought the
        family until I could dress the part, and I fooled everybody
        but you.... And now I <i>am</i> grown up....
        It’s no fooling now.... And there you are, as far
        away as ever. So I said to myself, that man will have
        to be approached and stormed. He’ll never marry
        anybody, unless somebody asks him. No, you
        wouldn’t, Allen Blynn. You’re not a bit aggressive;
        you’re too courteous, too afraid of hurting folks’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
        feelings. Well, I want to be hurt.... So I’m coming
        right at you. Here’s your chance, Allen Blynn....
        Wait!... I figured it this way. It’s all mere
        custom, this woman-sitting-back-and-waiting business.
        I’ve got the same desire for my man as any man has
        for his woman. I want him. Shall I let him slip by?
        Not I. I’m going right for him. He’ll be startled
        at first, just the way women are—oh! I’ve talked
        with a lot of ’em!—but keeping right at it brings
        everything. Half the women don’t want the men that
        come at them; but the thought gets into their brains
        and grows until it bubbles over and swamps ’em. Oh,
        I know. Neddie Morris nearly had me, and so did
        Leopold; if you hadn’t been in my head one of ’em
        would have got me; it was just a matter of sliding....
        Now, Allen Blynn, you’re my man.” They
        were very close together at their diminutive little table.
        She could have touched his arms, almost without leaning
        forward. Her voice grew very soft and tender as
        she added, “Aren’t I the brazen one!”</p>

    <p>“Little woman,” he spoke with the greatest kindness.
        “Will you let me think this out?”</p>

    <p>She nodded. For a half-hour they watched the silly
        crowd and nibbled at sweetish frothy desserts and
        sipped at cold coffees. Overbibulous folks laughed in
        high keys, and the Hungarian orchestra, taking its
        cue from the diners, grew noisier and noisier. At this
        moment the bandsmen were working vigorously on the
        quietest of love themes; castanets and cymbals clashed
        and tanged and told all the world about “long years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
        ago in old Madrid, where softly sighs of love the light
        guitar.” The song had taken the country only a
        few years before, and had now reached the stage of
        orchestral “variations.” The Hungarian leader was
        consumed with passion and beer; he gesticulated and
        shouted to his workers, and they bent to their task.
        Every child in America knew the absurd words. Even
        Allen Blynn knew them!</p>

    <div class="poetry-container">

            <div class="indent2">Here alone I wait for thee.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Mischievously Gorgas accompanied with the words
        of the refrain, she pianissimo, the orchestra thundering
        double forte to its climax. They smiled guiltily as
        they thought of the smashing, gesticulating music and
        the personal significance of the libretto.</p>

    <p>“Well,” he turned to her.</p>

    <p>“Well?” she rested her arms on the little table so
        that her two hands almost touched him.</p>

    <p>“This is the greatest experience of my life,” he said
        soberly, “absolutely the greatest and the finest.” His
        face shone with exultation. “It is the last thing I
        dreamed of. I thought it was Leopold. The fact is—well,
        I was mortally sure. We talked together just
        before I left. He didn’t tell me outright, but I knew,
        of course. Naturally I couldn’t guess the details....
        That <i>is</i> a revelation!...”</p>

    <p>Already she thought she had read his answer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
        withdrew her hands ever so slightly. Except for a
        deeply flushed face and sparkling eyes she gave no other
        sign; she was prepared for it to take time!</p>

    <p>“Here alone I wait for thee!” the orchestra
        shouted.</p>

    <p>“It’s hard to talk here. Come,” he looked earnestly
        at his watch as if he had never seen one before.
        “We’ll cab it for my hotel, where I must get your
        birthday gift—the manuscript book, you know....
        Then I’ll see you to your train.... We have barely
        a half-hour.”</p>

    <p>St. Acetum had not tumbled from the roof of the
        Heaven as Bardek had predicted; he seemed, rather, to
        be all too intent on his eternal patching and repairing.
        It was very assuring; one felt safe and protected; now,
        whatever else happened, the Heavens would not fall!
        For in spite of Bardek’s jests at the expense of the
        Saint, Gorgas knew that the good man would not so
        easily desert his high duties for anything merely personal.
        Still, she wished that he might at least just
        look down!</p>

    <p>At her side of the cab she sat rigid; without a word
        she let him get out at the hotel and return with the
        gift; but as they drew near the railway terminal, she
        put a trembling hand on his shoulder.</p>

    <p>“Won’t you even touch me?” she asked plaintively.</p>

    <p>“Please! please!” he begged; and she withdrew to
        her place. <i>Nom d’une pipe! Nom du nom d’une pipe!</i></p>

    <p>“I’m not a bit sorry I came,” she said finally.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>“Nor am I! Nor am I!” he replied fervently.
        “I feel—glorified!”</p>

    <p>They walked slowly, like two tired persons, to her
        car. He saw about her tickets and bade her goodby
        at the steps.</p>

    <p>“Is there—somebody else?” she asked quietly.</p>

    <p>“Gracious, no!” he cried; but immediately he said,
        “Wait!” and looked worried. “Yes,” he corrected,
        “there is—and there isn’t at all!” His lips closed
        firmly, but his eyes seemed to be telling her not to believe
        a word of it.</p>

    <p>“This little book,” he put the package into her hand
        hastily, as if he were eager to change the topic, “is
        five years of my life. It will explain what I have not
        been able to say to you tonight. But you are not to
        open it until your eighteenth birthday.”</p>

    <p>“That is tomorrow—and tomorrow is almost
        here,” she told him. “In a few moments I’ll be eighteen.”</p>

    <p>“Yes, I know!” he agreed. “So you will be!
        Well! well! On your ride home, then, you may read
        it. There is just one condition: you must begin at the
        beginning, and go straight through—‘Through hedge
        and over gate. Straight! straight! straight!
        straight!’” he quoted. “Promise!”</p>

    <p>She promised.</p>

    <p>The porters began to take on the appearance of getting
        under way; the Midnight Express was a punctual
        institution.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>“All aboard!” someone called afar off. “Express
        for Philadelphia and Washington! All aboard!”</p>

    <p>She leaned up to him with flaming invitation in her
        face.</p>

    <p>“No one will know,” she said. “Quick! They’ll
        think we’re brother and sister!”</p>

    <p>A big clock tolled the first stroke of twelve. He
        took her face in his hands so tempestuously as to
        startle and hurt, but she laughed.</p>

    <p>“All aboard!”</p>

    <p>“Go quick!” he cried.</p>

    <p>The conductor was impatient. Boom! boom! the
        big clock finished out its twelve slow strokes.</p>

    <p>“Many happy returns of the day,” he called after
        the moving train. She said nothing, but she waved until
        the darkness enveloped her.</p>

            “STRAIGHT! STRAIGHT! STRAIGHT! STRAIGHT!”</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="drop-cap">“I ’M not a bit sorry I came,” she said aloud as
        she fumbled around the zigzag corners of two
        Pullmans until she reached her own drawing-room.
        And she was not; she was most unreasonably
        elated; she had, she knew not why, all the humming
        sensations of victory. It was unaccountable. She
        sat on her couch and tried to fathom the meaning of her
        snug contentedness. She retold the full day together,
        the “window-cracking,” the luncheon in state, the jogs
        about strange streets, the applauding crowd at the
        lecture, the garish Hungarian café, the confession and
        its almost painful reception, and the tumultuous parting.
        She ought to have been depressed, but she was
        throbbing with joy. “It was good, every minute of
        it,” she said.</p>

    <p>Mechanically she undid the wrappings from Allen’s
        birthday gift, arranged the pillows and the light, and
        prepared to read. The outside of the book was the
        simple adjustable cover of a college note-book, but a
        gold-leafed title had been printed across the front:</p>

    <p class="center">Unclaimed Letters</p>

    <p>She turned to the first page carefully, remembering,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span></p>

    <p class="center">Through hedge, over gate<br>
        Straight! straight! straight! straight!</p>

    <p>There she found a subtitle: Letters to Gorgas Levering;
        to be delivered into her hands on the twentieth
        anniversary of her birth; dictated from time to time
        by the heart of an old comrade and withheld from the
        post by his conscience. (Later note: “twentieth”
        amended to “eighteenth” but under stern protest of
        said conscience.)</p>

    <p>The first letter was dated June 17, 1888. It was a
        date she knew by heart. Every year she had celebrated
        secretly the anniversary of the meeting at the
        tennis-court. She read:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“Dear Gorgas Levering: You have given me a
            psychological shock: you have unhinged my reason, let
            loose my emotions, and upset my moral apple cart!
            You did all that, and you know nothing about it.
            When you grow up—say, at twenty or twenty-one—I
            shall present you with this document of evidence, and
            if you have any sense of decency at that age you will
            be shocked too. No little girl of thirteen with a face
            like a madonna should be allowed to tuck her legs under
            her pinafore and impose upon a grown up man what
            shaves every day. (The seeming irrelevancy of these
            remarks is not due to lunacy—although it is yet disputed
            if the moon does not have something to do with
            it—but to a fine scientific ardor. All the facts must
            be recorded and in this case concealed legs is facts.)</p>

        <p>“All my life I have stopped in the middle of experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
            and recorded my feelings. I say, ‘Allen Blynn,
            you feel this way or that way.’ This helps me to remember
            later; for all our lives we are stuffing and
            changing and forgetting our former selves. Hence I
            hereby solemnly affirm that if I had the courage to
            smash all the conventions of my civilization and put a
            good-sized gash into the moral code of my contemporaries,
            I, Allen Blynn, male, white, and a voter,
            would have picked you up in my arms today at the tennis-courts,
            hugged the daylight out of you, tossed you
            across my shoulders, made straight for the nearest
            clergyman and married you—with one hand across
            your mouth to prevent your squealing and the other
            firmly grasping your struggling legs.</p>

        <p>“That would be kidnapping—punishable by life
            imprisonment. I know it. And also grand larceny.
            Of course it is. And something like piracy. Right!
            Yet, I did none of these things; sheer cowardice held
            my hands; but if to have murder in the heart is to be
            murderer, as I believe, then I stand here convicted of
            the desire to own you, bag and baggage, legs, and all.</p>

        <p>“And you are thirteen years old, and I am twenty-three!</p>

        <p>“It is shameful, isn’t it? But I am brazenly unashamed.

    <p>“And I wouldn’t have squealed a bit,” Gorgas
        crooned. “I’d have trotted right along—in the lead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
        too. I bet he doesn’t know the shortest cut to the parsonage.”</p>

    <p>“June 21,” the next letter began.</p>

    <p>“That was the Wednesday afternoon he first came
        to the house,” she commented.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“Dear Gorgas Levering: Psychological facts are
            accumulating.</p>

        <p>“Fact No. 1: I am still a criminal-at-large and more
            dangerous than ever.</p>

        <p>“Fact No. 2: I slipped back five years this afternoon
            and became eighteen. The proof is we both had a gallumptious
            time mimicking the neighborhood and acted
            like a pair of school children. Further proof is that
            you continually did make eyes at me, and, in spite of
            all the roaring protestations of something that’s left
            of my conscience, my own did slip several times. They
            really did slip: they slid nearer and nearer; from your
            chin they drew up to the tip of your nose; clambered
            up, up, slowly, overran the mark, and perched
            perilously on the right eyebrow; leaned over for a dizzy
            second and—slipped into untold brown fathoms.
            Once I was nearly drowned. It was the most terrifying
            sensation of my young manhood.</p>

        <p>“Fact No. 3: I was mortally ashamed—put that
            down to my credit (you were not, you rogue!)
            and resolved never to do it again. The Lord have
            mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law.</p>

        <p>“Fact No. 4: That gypsy scamp scares me into
            trembles. When you told me of him I had murder in
            my heart, then and there; all the fierce primitive desire
            <span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>to meet that beast and beat him into pulp. My
            voice shook so when I asked you about him that I was
            certain you noticed it. My nesting instincts are coming
            with a rush—and they are most terrifying.
        </p>

        <p>“Fact No. 5: In daylight I admit none of these
            things. I am very moral and civilized in daylight.
            Only at night when I sit before this white paper does
            my inward, honest self come to the fore and disport
            his naked savagery.</p>

        <p>“Fact No. 6: The two ‘me’s’ are fighting each
            other; daylight against darkness. Daylight is going
            to win, or it’s all over with Allen Blynn (see the state
            your rhyming’s put me in!)</p>

        <p class="right">“Still criminal, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            “Allen Blynn.”
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>The next letters were full of vindictive hatred of
        Bardek. Allen had gone to the old mill and found it
        deserted. He told how all his talk on Elizabethan love
        with Kate as they drove along the Wissahickon was
        only the outward voice speaking; within were throbbing
        anxious cries for a little child off in the woods with—what
        sort of a man? The Lord only knew. Elizabethan
        love—contagion, infection, plague and what
        not—he had them all, a virulent case. With wide
        eyes Gorgas read of his tramp back into the dark of
        Cresheim Valley and how he had seen her forlorn little
        figure pacing thoughtfully beside “Gyp.” Only
        vigorous conscience withheld his hands from touching
        her as she passed by.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
        twenty—terrible! a life-time of exile. Perhaps
        one might make it nineteen—No! said Conscience,
        roaring outrageously. Well, twenty, then.</p>

    <p>The “German days,” “French days,” and “Italian
        days” followed in review, while Gorgas passed from
        thirteen to fourteen. His joy at the discovery of the
        simple sincerity of Bardek flowed through the pages,
        with just a hint of watchfulness. “He is a man, a
        free-thinker, a free-lover, too, I suspect,” he warned
        her. “Look out for him, child; but you need not do
        that. I am on eternal guard, now. He has no conscience,
        that is certain; but in some matters neither
        have I. If he makes a step toward you ‘I would eat his
        heart out in the market-place!’ But I have faith in
        Bardek, an unreasoned thing, but clear enough. Time
        will tell.</p>

    <p>“And I’m watching you, too, Golden Child. Your
        brown eyes do not behave themselves. They explore,
        explore, explore, until I am ready to reach out my hand
        and close them against myself. And you continually
        do pluck at my sleeve and touch my wrist nervously
        with the tips of your hot fingers and send my blood
        slamming and jamming and ramming and cramming
        like the waters go down at Lodore. You have no conscience,
        either; that’s plain. Well, here’s where I begin
        my long vigil. Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
        nineteen, twenty—it is life imprisonment. I’ll be an
        old man! Shall we say nineteen then? Golly! What
        a racket Conscience sets up!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>At another time he wrote briefly. “You stood in
        the narrow path today, when we found that Bardek
        had gone, and reached out your arms to me. By the
        Great Horn Spoon! By the Dipper and the Little
        Bear! <i>And</i> the Pole Star! <i>And</i> the Pleiades! Don’t
        ever do that again! Zounds! Flesh and blood, that’s
        all I’m made of! Fra Lippo Lippi said that. Fortunately
        for you and me I’m flesh and blood plus a Conscience.”</p>

    <p>“And I never guessed it!” Gorgas communed with
        herself. “If I had—” The first touch of remorse
        seized her for the lost chances of life, and a little anger
        at the laws of polite society, and a pang of jealousy
        for that “other” whom he had so dubiously confessed.</p>

    <p>“Why does he torture me with this book of letters?”
        she marvelled. A few leaves slipped through
        her fingers; she turned impatiently toward the concluding
        pages, but stopped. “I’ll play fair,” she said.
        “Straight! straight! straight! straight!”</p>

    <p>Morris came into the letters. Allen had noticed
        greedily their intimacy and lamented the early bookishness
        that had prevented his ever being more than a
        spectator at athletics. Some of the fierce passions of
        envy seized him. He was gloriously frank. “I’m a
        half-man,” he exclaimed. “They let me sit and spell
        out books and praised me until my vanity led me
        further and further away from real life. Why couldn’t
        they have driven me off to baseball and football and
        all that! The world praises the pedant, but the young
        woman goes straight to a <i>man</i>. I have had the education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
        of a woman—and even women are repudiating it,
        nowadays.”</p>

    <p>He was very unfair to himself in these despondent
        pages. Gorgas quarreled with every line. She scolded
        him; told him what his real qualities were and advised
        him to have more sense or she would skip. It
        was the “Sorrows of Allen Blynn,” the aching of strong
        youth before he has found his place, when he cries out
        upon his own unfitness for any place at all. “These
        are just my growing pains, child,” he was wise enough
        to write. “Don’t bother your little head about them;
        it’ll come out all right eventually.” But it made her
        uncomfortable and weepy.</p>

    <p>At the top of the next page a street address gave
        her a sudden pleasurable thrill:</p>

    <p class="center">18/a Fürstenstrasse, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
        München, Deutschland.</p>

    <p>“Oh!” Gorgas gasped in delight. “He really did
        write from Germany, after all.”</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“<i>Mein Kindschen</i>,” it began. “Frau Schloss talked
            of your letter even before she would arrange the price
            of breakfasts and bed. There has been a great to do
            over your letter. It came several days before I arrived.
            And it was a bulky document—thick, extravagant
            American letter-paper is to the German mind like
            feeding lamb chops to stray dogs. And it lacked
            stamps mightily.</p>

        <p>“The question that confronted the Frau Schloss,
            the Herr Schloss, the Gemüse Frau, who keeps a green-grocery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
            below stairs, and the Herr Postman—the
            question that has stirred them for the past fortnight
            is whether it is a safe investment to pay the overdue
            postage, trusting that the Herr Professor would later
            make restitution plus <i>trinkgeld</i>; or deny all knowledge
            of the Herr Professor and throw the responsibility
            upon the efficient German postal service. Well!
            They decided that the Herr Professor would be an easy
            American mark, as he had been on former visits; so
            they paid out real money, received the letter, and took
            the big risk that I might not have recovered from the
            American madness of paying large sums with a smile.</p>

        <p>“As I arrived in the Fürstenstrasse, Frau Schloss
            saw me from the window above the green-grocery and
            hastened down the dark stair and through the darker
            alley of a vestibule (where the Gemüse Frau keeps her
            push-cart) to meet me breathless in front of the
            Vegetable Lady’s display.</p>

        <p>“‘I suppose I may have my old rooms?’ I asked, after
            the first formal greetings.</p>

        <p>“‘Oh, the letter, my honored Herr Professor!’ she
            began tragically.</p>

        <p>“‘Ah!’ I caught her up. ‘I cannot have the rooms
            then? I’m sorry.’</p>

        <p>“‘Yes! yes!’ she assured me, ‘Yes, honored Herr
            Professor. The rooms are ready. And the letter is
            ready, too! It came a week ago. We have kept it
            for you—’</p>

        <p>“‘We have kept it,’ said Herr Schloss, emerging
            from the dark hall.</p>

        <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>“‘—and have paid,’ beamed Frau Schloss anxiously.</p>

        <p>“‘We have indeed paid,’ helped Herr Schloss.</p>

        <p>“‘I have seen them pay,’ corroborated the Gemüse
            Frau, looming from the dark doorway.</p>

        <p>“Oh, they held me with a glittering eye, Frau
            Schloss, Herr Schloss, and the Gemüse Frau, as I
            listened to their tale, awaited the bringing forth of the
            letter and stood silent and noncommittal throughout
            the profuse explanation of each glaring governmental
            mark that announced money due.</p>

        <p>“‘Bless my soul!’ I cried in English; ‘it’s from
            Gorgas.’ And I ripped it open right before them,
            ejaculated my joy in their very faces—we were still
            on the sidewalk in front of the house—thanked them
            in flowery German and passed rapidly by to my old
            rooms without so much as a hint of payment.</p>

        <p>“They followed me.</p>

        <p>“‘Is it then an important letter?’ anxiously inquired
            the Frau Schloss.</p>

        <p>“‘Important?’ I echoed. ‘It is worth a million
            Dutch thalers.’</p>

        <p>“Then I saw their faces. ‘Oh’ I sensed their
            trouble. ‘My best thanks for your thoughtfulness;
            pray, accept this little token,’ and I passed the lady
            the sum of twelve cents—a silver fifty-pfennig piece—a
            Bavarian ransom. As the postage amounted to
            only twenty-five pfennig, this gave the family a clear
            rake-off of six American cents. Ah! there was joy in
            the Schloss family that night, and for days the Gemüse
            Frau shone by reflected glory. Thrift! What would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
            we Americans in Germany do without thrift in the Germans!</p>

        <p>“I am purposely keeping away from your letter.
            All this introductory setting is to tantalize myself, to
            force myself to be calm and see things straight. At
            the slightest excuse I could gush forth on these pages
            a quantity and quality of sentiment that would make
            your six-page outcry seem quite sensible and respectable.
            (And it is neither, you know, <i>mein Kindschen</i>.)
            You tell me things here that I know only too well.
            Maybe that’s why I am in Germany. You hint that
            I could marry you by crooking my little finger. Down
            here in Bavaria they often do that sort of thing at
            exactly your age—fifteen and one-half. But if I
            should do it, or encourage you to think that I might
            even want to do it—well! I have read enough Italian
            literature to know that there is a particularly private
            pit in Hell reserved for those chaps. So I am going to
            perform a bit of moral cruelty which makes me ill to
            think of—and is bound to make me iller as the days
            and nights go by—I am going to ignore your truthful
            little confession; act brutally as if you had never
            penned it; pretend that I never could guess how you
            would count the days it takes for a letter to cross the
            ocean, arrive at Hamburg, drift down to Munich; how
            you would count again the days it takes a reply to come
            up to Hamburg and sail to New York; how for days
            and days and months and months you would watch for
            the postman, trying all the while to look unconcerned,
            and find each day—silence. You are not the kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
            of child to grow busy with your playthings and forget.
            I know how you will suffer—worse now, perhaps, than
            if you were older. And I make you suffer because
            there is no other way.</p>

        <p>“There is no other way; I may make no explanation.
            If I told you the truth you would probably take
            the next steamer for Europe; and if I acted the way I
            feel, I’d probably meet you half way over. And I can’t
            write you a lame acknowledgment that I have received
            your letter, have it on file and will attend to your order
            in due course. The coldest thing I wrote would burn
            with the lie that it carried and you would guess and be
            tempted by me. No. I am like a man in love with his
            friend’s wife. There is nothing to do. I must keep
            the faith—which means, in this case, silence.</p>

        <p>“It is so horrible, the thing I must do, that I almost
            forget how you have paid in advance for my necessary
            brutality. This fragile, badly-spelled, pink-rose-leaf
            confession of yours, so delicately real, like a half-opened
            cherry-bud, warm, fragrant, potent with all
            that is to be! I could send it back to you, <i>mein Kindschen</i>,
            and say, ‘All that you own here, I confess again
            to you. Speak; and whatever you say, that will be
            but the echo of myself.’</p>

        <p>“And I shall say nothing. But my heart is full of
            pity, <i>mein Kindschen</i>.”</p>
    </div>

    <p>They were crossing the river above New York city
        before she had been able to finish three-quarters of the
        book; the cars were shifted carefully and tenderly to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
        flat-bottomed ferry; in a few moments they were being
        towed down the river to Jersey City. She could look
        out of her window and see the lights of the river and
        hear the water lapping the sides of the boat. Much
        meditation had gone with each page; and she was reluctant
        to come to the impending end.</p>

    <p>Leopold appeared in the letters. “I am playing a
        losing game, I know,” he wrote. “While I wait and
        look fatherly (and get called <i>mon père</i>—ugh!) someone
        else, less scrupulous—and a blamed sight more
        natural!—will reach out and take you.... <i>Nom
            d’une pipe!</i>... My word is given, however, and I will
        not break it. <i>Hier stehe ich, Gott mir helfen, ich kann
            nicht anders</i>; so said Luther, or something like that,
        on a matter that seems to me less important!”</p>

    <p>Almost immediately after this he was rowing most
        gloriously with Conscience and bringing the years down
        to eighteen. “Something ought to be knocked off for
        good behavior,” he argued; “every decent prison allows
        that. But there’s the final stand. One step this side—one
        minute even, and I’d never forgive myself.
        Seventeen, eighteen! Two years of acting-grandfather,
        playing the wise old professor, <i>so</i> interested in education!
        Rats!”</p>

    <p>Now he was leaving abruptly for Holden, decamping
        in the night, fleeing before the attack of the tempter.
        The devil had got into him; the Old One needed vigorous
        exorcising.</p>

    <p>The Old One came in for a long essay. The devil
        was God’s ally, he found out; Lucifer tried men out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
        tested them, showed up the flaws, taught them exactly
        what to amend, reject or add. Spiritual perfection
        was not possible without a healthy, vigorous tussle with
        the Old One.</p>

    <p>“I know when he is coming,” he claimed; “first, I
        hear the cries of the old mystery-play devils, ‘Out
        haro! Out haro! Out! out! out!’ just like a pack
        of yelping dogs on a hot scent. Then I find my heart,
        blood, lungs, vertebræ, stomach, legs, and sympathetic
        nervous system all going back on me. The flesh and
        the devils are old cronies, you know. ‘Out! out! Out
        haro! Out! out!’ he howls, nearer and nearer; my
        whole physical ‘me’ tugs and yowls and bites at the
        leash.</p>

    <p>“Then the real ‘me’ takes a fresh grip and holds
        fast. I slip and slide a little, but dig my feet in the
        stones, and pray—”</p>

    <p>“I know. I know,” nodded Gorgas.</p>

    <p>“—Then I throw the thong over my shoulders,”
        Allen went on, “turn my back on the fiend and drag
        that other part of ‘me,’ heart, stomach, and all, straight
        up on firm ground. Every step’s a better one.”</p>

    <p>“My legs get away from me,” Gorgas commented
        ruefully. “They just took me off to Boston. And
        I’m not a bit sorry—and <i>that’s</i> funny, too.”</p>

    <p>Seventeen was the hardest year. The grown-up
        gowns were not lost on him. “Attire of the devil’s
        making,” he wrote. “A snare of the Old One,—<i>Retro,
            Sathanas!</i> Get thee behind me. Not a minute before
        the hour set, or all my life I shall feel depraved.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>The Old One argued with him. He gave a part of
        the debate:</p>

    <p>“Old One: Why grow solemn-faced over so simple
        a matter! She’s a woman and you’re a man.</p>

    <p>“Allen B.: She’s a child and I <i>am</i> a man, thank the
        Lord, full-grown and in control of himself.</p>

    <p>“Old One: (sneering) Are you a man? Oh, no,
        you’re not. You’re neither male nor female. You’re
        a pedagogue.</p>

    <p>“A. B.: (wincing) <i>Touchez bien!</i> A hit! Whatever
        I am, I am going to be decent.</p>

    <p>“Old One: (artfully) All the unnatural things and
        all the disagreeable ones are decent. In Constantinople
        it isn’t decent for a woman to show her lips. Man invented
        that word, ‘decent.’ With God there is no
        decent or indecent. He made ’em all, the good and the
        bad. Don’t you know your Browning? He made you,
        Allen Blynn, what you are.</p>

    <p>“A. B.: And he made you, you canker! And he
        made me strong to fight you. <i>Retro!</i> Imp of Darkness!
        ’Raus!</p>

    <p>“Old One: <i>Are</i> you so strong?</p>

    <p>“A. B.: No!... Get out!</p>

    <p>“Old One: Neither is Leopold—Leopold, your
        bosom-friend—</p>

    <p>“A. B.: (smiting him) Back to hell, you miserable
        liar! Back! Back!</p>

    <p>“Old One: (retreating) Ho! ho! ho! ho! Out
        haro! out haro! ho! ho! Neither is Leopold!...
        Leopold!... Leopold!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>On other pages he was full of hope. The dream had
        come true. He was planning out his life with her.
        “We must make this go right,” he said. “The world
        is writing its books against us. Every little novelist
        and every little playwright is hinting dark things
        against marriage. They sneer at all the habits of the
        race and cry, ‘Liberty for the emotions.’ ‘Love thy
        neighbor as thyself,’ they tempt, ‘and also thy neighbor’s
        wife. Marriage is servitude and a restriction;
        let’s wallow and be natural.’ Liars and servants of the
        Old One, every mother’s son. But we must watch carefully.
        Marriage is like any other attempt at living;
        it must be tended and watched and fed, not squandered
        or tossed about. We’ll spend our store of affection
        like other gifts, not lavishly all at once in one mad
        spree, but with rare economy; and we’ll keep adding
        new funds to the old by sharing associations together.
        We must not begin to have separate interests or even
        different friends. Marriage is a wonderful art; the
        ideal is ever beyond achievement, but it is worth striving
        for.... Did you say, ‘Honorificabilitudinitatibus’?</p>

    <p>“I have two complete and separate lives,” he wrote
        further; “the one I live in the day-time, serious, mature,
        full of windy arguments of state, books, religion,
        literature, education; the one I live at night when the
        hurlyburly of the day is done and I travel these pages
        with you. My very style is different in these two personalities.
        In the broad light of day I am somewhat
        stilted and over-oldish for one so young; here with you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
        sitting sleepy-eyed in the chair before me, I am lithe and
        bold and gay and boyish. There are no sweethearts
        in the day-time for Allen Blynn. And that’s a good
        thing, too; or he couldn’t do a proper day’s work.
        Sometimes you do bob in, but I rise politely, put on my
        spectacles, usher you firmly to the door and bid you a
        pleasant but peremptory ‘good morning.’ Sometimes
        you slip in by the window, and then I am done for.”</p>

    <p>The “Lady of the Interruption” came in for a comment
        or two. “You have a wrong notion of that Lady;
        and I have encouraged it; you ask such persistent questions
        about her eyes and her hair and her dresses—about
        all of which I know nothing. She is at least fifty,
        but I have carefully concealed that from you. Your
        wide-open eyes see a life-partner there and I affect to
        wonder if it might not be. That’s playing the game
        square—a little too square, perhaps. At any rate it
        is right penance for all my sins of desire; and it pleases
        Conscience mightily and makes the Old One howl.”</p>

    <p>Those dictated letters to the family! Great Scott!
        How self-conscious and bookish they were. Daylight
        wrote every line of them, affirmed Allen Blynn.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>Dawn was slowly touching the edge of a New Jersey
        pine wood; but Gorgas was not at all aware of that.
        Never had sleep seemed so foreign to her needs.</p>

    <p>Breathlessly she read on until within a page or two
        of the end.</p>

    <p>“What does he mean? What does he mean?” she
        fingered the scant leaves that remained. “He said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
        there was another—‘There is—and there isn’t at all,’
        he said.”</p>

    <p>The end came abruptly. It was dated only a few
        weeks ago. Before he had left for his lecture trip he
        had had a casual talk with Leopold, he wrote. What
        Leopold really said is not recorded—Leopold was too
        honest a man to have lied—but, nevertheless, Allen
        Blynn came away with the certain impression that the
        long vigil had come to naught. Poets, lovers and madmen
        have such seething brains!</p>

    <p>“I have climbed to my ‘Top-o’-the-hill,’” wrote
        Allen; “beyond is Canaan, but it is not for me.”</p>

    <p>“How could he? How could he?” Gorgas whispered.
        “This is terrible, Allen Blynn.” Solicitude
        for her man quite outweighed her own loss.</p>

    <p>She read on: “Within sight of the promised land
        I must die and be buried in the Valley of Moab,” he
        wrote on the final page. “What sin I have committed
        I know not.... And now you will never find me out,
        my child. Your birthday gift—this book of absurd
        confessions—must be buried with me.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>“‘And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead,
            unto Dan and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim
            and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the
            utmost sea, and the South, and the Plain of the Valley
            of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.... And
            He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab; but
            no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.’”</p>
    </div>

    <p>“Finis” was written in deliberate ink; but a white
        space below had left room for a scrawl in pencil: “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
        are out there in the cab, little woman, and Canaan is
        around and about me; yet I must not speak. When
        you read these pages you will know and understand.
        The Old One is fighting hard with me to break the
        faith; but I cannot, now. <i>Our life together must not
            begin this way.</i> You must go home, and I must not
        have it on my soul that I even so much as touched you.
        There is a way that <i>seemeth</i> right unto a man, but the
        end thereof are the ways of death. In my stupid, iron-set,
        prejudiced, superstitious brain you are a child until
        tomorrow. Tomorrow you will be something other, my
        right woman. That other I will claim, but—tomorrow.
        <i>Tomorrow!</i>
    </p>

    <p>“Your ecstatic, maybe-foolish, and altogether glorified,</p>

    <p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Vinegar Saint</span>.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, Allen Blynn! Allen Blynn!” the tearful little
        woman laughed in her joy. “You are <i>too</i> funny!
        You are <i>too, too</i> funny!”</p>

            even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
            paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

            Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
            of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
            works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
            States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
            United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
            claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
            displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

            works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
            Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
            comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
            same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
            you share it without charge with others.

            1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

        <div>
            1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
            effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
            works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
            Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
            contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
            or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
            intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
            other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
            cannot be read by your equipment.

            liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
            fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
            LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
            PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
            TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
            LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
            INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGE.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
            defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
            receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
            written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
            received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
            with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
            with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
            lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
            or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
            opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
            the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
            without further opportunities to fix the problem.

        <div>
            1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
            in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
            OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
            LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

            1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
            warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
            damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
            violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
            agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
            limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
            unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
            remaining provisions.

        <div>

            accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
            production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
            including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
            the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
            or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or

        </div>

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
            electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
            computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
            exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
            from people in all walks of life.
        </div>

        <div>
            Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
            goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
            remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
            and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
            generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
            Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

            Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
        </div>

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
            public support and donations to carry out its mission of
            increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
            freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
            array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
            ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
            status with the IRS.
        </div>

        <div>
            The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
            where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
        </div>

        <div>
            While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.
        </div>

        <div>
            International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
        </div>

        <div>
            Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
            methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

            Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
        </div>

        <div>
            Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
            Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
            freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
            volunteer support.
        </div>

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
            editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
            the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
            necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
            edition.
