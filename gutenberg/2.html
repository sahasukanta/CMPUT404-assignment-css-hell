            <small>THE CAREWS OF DEVON</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of King Henry VIII., between
        Honiton and Exeter, at Luppit, stood Mohun’s
        Ottery, the great house of the Carews of
        Devon. Built like a fortress, it was too strong
        to be reduced, save by cannon, and its walls
        had sheltered for many years a race of gallant
        gentlemen, while its gates were ever open with
        a generous hospitality that welcomed both the
        rich and the poor. Its furnishings and tapestries
        were so magnificent that it was commonly
        reported that they would grace the king’s
        palace at Greenwich and not suffer by contrast
        with any royal trappings.</p>

    <p>The Carews were famous, both at home and
        abroad, and had been since the first Carru
        came over with the Norman Conqueror. There
        was never a quarrel on English soil, or for the
        English cause, that a Carew was not in the
        forefront of the battle. One had been Lord
        Lieutenant of Ireland, one a captain of Harfleur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
        for King Henry V., and another fought for
        Henry VII. A proud and valiant race, claiming
        kindred with the Geraldines, loyal and courteous
        to their friends and ready with sword and
        dagger for England’s foes and their own. Sir
        William Carew, the head of the Devon branch
        of the family, held noble sway at Mohun’s
        Ottery, and day by day a hundred poor and
        more were fed by his open hand, for in those
        times there was no niggardly charity, although
        the king’s laws spared not the valiant beggar.
        Every gentleman’s house was in itself a tavern,
        and men of all conditions came unbidden to the
        board, finding, too, a night’s lodging, even
        though it might be but a bed of straw upon the
        stone floor of the hall. The food was neither
        scanty nor of mean order; cooks who fed a hundred
        or so at one meal were accustomed to
        serving in a day beef, mutton, venison, pigs,
        geese, plovers, curlews, besides pike, bream,
        and porpoise, and of ale and wine there was
        no lack. A plentiful, free feast that drew a
        multitude of pensioners; the odors that floated
        from the kitchens, even on a fast day, brought
        a retinue of visitors to the doors, and after
        meal time the sounds of revelry told their
        own story, giving ample proof that there were
        no empty stomachs.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>It was Shrove Tuesday in the year 1535,
        and the midday dinner was over at Mohun’s
        Ottery, as great a company as usual having
        been entertained. Upon the doorstep stood
        Sir William Carew and his guest, Master
        Raleigh, the father of Sir Walter, who was
        then unborn. These two worthies were engaged
        in deep and grave converse upon public
        matters, for the Act of the Supremacy had been
        followed by the Treason Act, and Sir Thomas
        More and Bishop Fisher were in the Tower,
        having refused to take the oath without conditions.
        So there was no lack of matter for discussion,
        and the faces of these two were neither
        unruffled nor jolly, though they had so lately
        dined. However, their conversation was
        doomed to a sharp interruption. A horse and
        rider came suddenly in sight upon the high-road,
        advancing at so mad a gait that both men
        paused in their talk to watch the approach. A
        great bay horse, flecked with foam and with
        blood upon his flank, showing a cruel spur, and
        on his back a large and handsome man, gayly
        dressed, his velvet cloak embroidered with gold
        and his hat beplumed, but reeling in his saddle,
        keeping his seat, as it seemed, only by a miracle.</p>

    <p>“It is Sir Thomas,” Raleigh remarked, after
        a second glance at the red face of the rider.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Ay,” retorted Carew, bitterly, “my worthy
        brother and, as usual, in his cups. A naughty
        rogue it is, and like to be a disgrace to his
        blood.”</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he fixed a scornful gaze upon
        the drunken man who was now coming to the
        door, trying, too, to sit straight in the saddle,
        as if he knew that his brother’s disapproving
        eyes were on him. A little way from the
        entrance stood a large stone horse-block, from
        which the women of the household mounted,
        and toward this Sir Thomas Carew urged his
        horse.</p>

    <p>“He has been gaming at Exeter,” Sir
        William remarked coldly; “he is ever thus
        after he has been brawling and drinking in a
        public house. I have not seen him for a
        twelvemonth, and I doubt not that he comes
        to borrow a hundred pounds; such is like
        to be his case. ’Pon my soul, a meritorious
        beggar!”</p>

    <p>The words were scarcely spoken ere Sir
        Thomas struck his spur again into his horse’s
        bleeding flank. The great brute plunged,
        swerving madly to one side; his tipsy rider,
        reeling from the saddle, fell headlong upon the
        stone block, rolled over and lay in a hideous
        heap at his brother’s feet. The horse turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
        about as suddenly, trampled him under foot
        and rushed back toward the stables, clearing a
        wide path in the crowd of spectators who had
        come out to view the accident. Sir William
        and Raleigh both hastened to the fallen man,
        but something in the limpness of his figure
        told its own story. He lay face downward,
        and they turned him over to find a lump of
        mangled flesh, his neck being broken just
        below the skull, and his drink-blurred eyes
        stared into space.</p>

    <p>“Stone dead,” Carew said sternly; “cut off
        in his sins. God pity him, for he is like
        enough to be damned!”</p>

    <p>“Here is a sad end,” rejoined Raleigh,
        looking gravely at the dead man; “a gallant
        gentleman brought into such a case by evil
        communications. Lend a hand, good fellow,
        and we will carry in this body,” he added,
        addressing the nearest bystander, for the curious
        crowd had gathered in a constantly narrowing
        circle around the central figures.</p>

    <p>“Let be, Raleigh,” Sir William interposed
        coldly; “these grooms shall take him up; he
        deserved less for the dishonor he has brought
        upon his name.”</p>

    <p>With the same proud indignation, unforgiving
        even to the dead, he directed the removal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
        of the corpse, and then he and Raleigh followed
        it into the house. Without, all tongues
        were loosed at their departure and gossip
        flowed on every hand, and there was food
        enough for it in such a life and such a death
        as this.</p>

    <p>“I told Sir Tom ’twould be so!” one of the
        spectators said, with the air of a man who felt
        justified; “that brute was like to end some
        man’s life, and who but a Carew would back
        him in the state of liquor that yonder poor
        gentleman was?”</p>

    <p>“That horse? Why, man, he held him above
        all else he had,” cried another; “he valued the
        beast above his daughter.”</p>

    <p>“Like enough,” was the reply; “certain it
        is that he valued him above his wife, poor
        lady!”</p>

    <p>“She has been dead these many years, I
        take it,” said a third; for, after the fashion of
        all such leeches, they were eager to discuss the
        affairs of the family whose substance they
        devoured.</p>

    <p>“Ay, dead enough, good luck to her!” rejoined
        the first speaker. “They do say Sir
        Thomas wagered her at dice the very night on
        which his daughter was born, and lost his bet,
        too; but his opponent levied not the debt, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
        the poor lady, dying not many years thereafter,
        perchance never knew it. Howbeit, it is
        certain that had she known it, she could
        not have hated him more heartily than she
        did.”</p>

    <p>“That’s true enough, my masters,” said an
        ancient crone. “I knew her woman, and a
        sorry death the poor thing made. Even at that
        hour her husband was as tipsy as he was but
        now, and came into her chamber blubbering, as
        a sot will sometimes, and with great oaths, that
        he would guard her child. My lady heeded
        not his voice, but cried out to her tirewoman
        that the end was near, and she thanked the
        dear God for it, and to let her go in peace!
        She looked but once at her little daughter and
        then fell to weeping and blessing her, saying
        that the queen would care for this lamb, and
        so turned her white face to the wall and
        died.”</p>

    <p>“The queen,—did she commend her baby
        to the queen?” they all exclaimed.</p>

    <p>“Ay, ay,” the old woman answered, “to the
        queen’s grace; there was but one queen then,
        but now there is the old queen and Queen Nan
        Bullen, and God wot how many queens there
        be!”</p>

    <p>“Hold thy tongue, mistress!” cried one;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
        “thou wilt be up by the Treason Act, and
        hang at Tyburn, if thou hast so foul a tongue!”</p>

    <p>“Belike I shall, and all of ye,” the old creature
        laughed shrilly; “but it would not profit
        much to twist my shrivelled neck, there be fairer
        ones that would furnish a better entertainment.”</p>

    <p>“Where is Carew’s child?” cried one whose
        thirst for knowledge was not yet slaked.</p>

    <p>“Hidden somewhere in that old nest of his,”
        returned one of the gossips; “a sad life she’s
        had of it and is like to be in a worse case yet.
        Sir Thomas never did her a good turn until
        this day; the worst he did was to father her.
        An ill-favored wench, too, when last I saw her,
        thin and yellow and with a cold way that made
        no friends.”</p>

    <p>“Then ye have not seen her lately,” the
        old woman said with a chuckle; “she has shot
        up like a young sapling, and has eyes like two
        stars, and a smile that will turn many a young
        fool’s head, albeit her purse is empty and her
        kirtle patched.”</p>

    <p>“Poor wench, poor Mistress Betty, my heart
        doth ache for her,” a kinder woman said,
        shaking her head.</p>

    <p>Strangely enough, at that same moment
        Mistress Betty Carew was spoken of within the
        house by Sir William and his wife. He turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
        from his brother’s corpse, a certain stern relenting
        in his face, and said to Lady Carew,
        “There is the child.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, we must have her here, William,” his
        wife replied at once; “you may not leave your
        own blood in so poor a strait as he is like to
        have left the maid.”</p>

    <p>Sir William mused. “How old is she?”
        he asked.</p>

    <p>“Seventeen, come Michaelmas,” Lady
        Carew replied, watchful of her husband’s face,
        her own heart full of compassion for the
        orphan.</p>

    <p>“I know not how she may be bred up,” he
        said doubtfully; “she was a plain wench when
        last I saw her, but that is five years since.
        Well, well, she must even come and follow
        this wretched man’s funeral, and then you
        and she will doubtless find a way to settle it
        to your own liking.”</p>

    <p>So it was that Mistress Betty came to
        Mohun’s Ottery; a tall, slim girl in a black
        gown and with a calm look on her young face
        that startled her uncle, so unlike was it to anything
        in youth. Sir Thomas was carried from
        the home of his ancestors with all due state
        and ceremony, but there was no pretence of
        mourning, and the well-born rogue was laid in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
        his narrow house without a tear. After it was
        over, the affairs of the orphan were soon disposed
        of by Sir William. Finding that she
        was dowerless, save for a beauty of which her
        childhood had given no promise, he kept her
        under his own roof, and she lived there until
        other events took her to far other scenes. She
        was then in her girlhood, growing every day in
        beauty of a strong and striking type, and carrying
        her head like a queen rather than a penniless
        maid living in dependence at her uncle’s
        house. Her form, though slender, gave the
        promise of a richer outline, and as she grew
        happier in her new home, a color came into
        her cheeks, a sparkle to her eyes that made
        her lovely in the sight of many who marvelled
        that so plain a child should grow so beautiful.
        Lady Carew fretted much, however, at the
        will that Mistress Betty showed, which brooked
        no crossing, and the tongue that could, in
        anger, cut like a whip, for this beauty was no
        saint. There was, however, that in her lordly
        nature which scorned all meanness and baseness,
        a nobility that shone through the imperfections
        of her temper like a star, and looked
        out through the windows of her great eyes,—eyes
        that were clear brown, heavily fringed
        with black lashes, and set beneath two straight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
        black brows. Her mouth closed, perhaps, a
        trifle too firmly for so young a woman, and her
        chin was clear cut as a man’s, but her voice
        was sweet and low, and there was witchery in
        her smile.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

            <small>A MESSENGER FROM MY LORD PRIVY SEAL</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Michaelmas</span> had come and gone, and it was
        past the middle of October when a messenger
        came down post-haste from London. It was
        after supper, and there was revelry among the
        retainers and visitors at Mohun’s Ottery. In
        the great hall, however, there were but few;
        Sir William had only his favored guest, Master
        Raleigh, and besides these two were Lady
        Carew, her daughter, Mistress Cicely, and her
        niece. There were three sons, but none were
        home. Peter, who ran away to France, was
        even then with Sir John Wallop; that same
        Sir Peter who made the barns of Crediton
        smoke for the Lord Protector in after years.
        That evening the little company sat about the
        fire, the women working with their needles in
        a group at the left, and at the right sat Raleigh
        watching his host brew a posset. It was a
        matter of grave import to Carew, and he let no
        other hand mix the rare composition, but stood
        over it; a noble figure, a man in middle life,
        having a fine head and grizzled hair, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
        keen, bright eye and strong jaw of a resourceful
        and stubborn nature. His rich dress of
        Flemish velvet, dark as the dregs of wine, his
        great lace ruff and heavy chain of gold, set
        off his person and made it the more striking
        in contrast to the darker, plainer garb of
        Raleigh. The guest watched his friend stir
        the beverage and smiled at his ardor.</p>

    <p>“What secret lurks in it,” he said, “that
        you let no man brew it for you, Carew? I
        should scarce be willing to take the pains that
        you have this night, though I do heartily
        acknowledge you the king of posset makers.”</p>

    <p>“If it be not worth the pains, it is not worth
        the drinking,” replied Sir William; “’tis like
        a fine child, it may not come into the world
        without some travail and a good leech. See you,
        friend Raleigh, there is a secret in stirring it
        aright and putting in the parts in due season.
        If the cream and almonds be not wisely boiled
        with the amber and musk, and if you heat not the
        sack before you put in the eggs, then is there
        confusion, worse than these late troubles have
        brought upon this realm, and caused much in the
        same way, too, by a domestic disagreement.”</p>

    <p>Master Raleigh shook his head gravely at
        this, his mind slipping away from the posset as
        his next words betrayed.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“It will be happy for the realm if it prove
        but a domestic quarrel,” he said thoughtfully,
        “since the Act of the Succession there can be
        no doubt that there is much foreign meddling,
        and, I fear me, plots against the king’s majesty,
        made over seas, are foster-mothered here at
        Bugden; albeit, I do not greatly blame that
        noble lady that she will not yield. To her it
        must seem a sore and bewildering visitation of
        evil.”</p>

    <p>“God help her!” cried Lady Carew; “she
        was a good wife to the king, and deserveth
        better at his hands.”</p>

    <p>“Hush, madam!” retorted her lord, sternly;
        “a woman’s heart is more full of pity than of
        wisdom. It is not for us to dispute the matter;
        there is talk enough, and no little harm from it.
        The marriage hath been set aside, and let us
        hear no more of it while there is another queen
        and an infant princess.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, it is an easy matter for a man to forget
        his wife for a pretty face,” replied the good
        dame, hotly; “this is a policy that men like,
        since it favoreth their own slips upon the road;
        but no good will come of it, I warrant.”</p>

    <p>Raleigh laughed, looking from the husband
        to the wife; and even Sir William smiled,
        though a little grimly.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“The women are all alike,” he said; “there
        is a great cackling amongst them over this,
        and if the petticoats could set the kingdom in
        order, I doubt not one fair lady would hang as
        high as Haman.”</p>

    <p>“I blame them not for their pity for one we
        know,” Raleigh answered quietly; “it seems,
        forsooth, a great wrong, yet would I not see
        the Lady Mary come to the throne to bring
        back the Bishop of Rome and the Spaniards.
        These last I loved not ever; albeit there is
        cause for mourning that we lose with them the
        Flanders trade. Yet my heart has not been
        in all these acts; the fall of Sir Thomas More
        was, in itself, grief enough to me, for I had
        much friendship for that virtuous gentleman.”</p>

    <p>“Could it not have been averted?” asked
        Lady Carew, sadly; “he and Fisher both
        consented to swear to the Act of the Succession,
        with an exception, as I heard; could not
        this suffice?”</p>

    <p>“Nay, madam,” Raleigh answered quietly,
        “since the very clauses they excepted to were
        those which did declare the king’s first marriage
        illegal, and his present one legal. Of
        what profit would it be to swear allegiance to
        the Princess Elizabeth and, in the same breath,
        to refuse her legitimacy? It may not be. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
        must have a settled succession; if the king
        have not male issue, I fear me there will be
        war in any case. Besides the Lady Mary and
        the troubles that my Lady Salisbury is like to
        hatch in the cause of the White Rose, there
        is the King of Scots, and verily no English
        stomach can digest him and not vomit.”</p>

    <p>“Nay, forsooth!” exclaimed Sir William;
        “there shall be no Scotch dressing to an English
        pudding while there is a sword in Devonshire.
        If the king could but get a boy there
        might be an end in peace, but as it is, one
        girl child set up against another, and one-half
        the kingdom crying ‘Mary,’ the other ‘Elizabeth,’
        and so blood and fire from Land’s End
        to the Tweed, and, eftsoons, the King of
        Scots!”</p>

    <p>“Friend Carew, let not thy posset burn, for
        all that,” said Master Raleigh, smiling, for in
        his vexation Sir William had well nigh forgotten
        his brewing.</p>

    <p>“’Tis ready,” Carew answered, taking it
        from the fire; “Cicely, wench, hast ground
        the amber and sugar for it?”</p>

    <p>As he spoke, there was a great stir without,
        the sound of hurrying feet and voices. The
        group by the fire paused in their talk to listen,
        and looked down toward the door at the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
        end. In a moment it was opened and an attendant
        came swiftly across the hall and addressed
        Sir William, who still stirred the posset while
        Mistress Cicely sprinkled the amber over it.</p>

    <p>“A messenger from London, your worship,”
        the servant announced hurriedly, “and he
        craves leave to speak with you at once.”</p>

    <p>“From whom?” asked Carew, shortly.</p>

    <p>“My lord privy seal,” replied the man, in
        an awestricken tone.</p>

    <p>Sir William’s face showed both surprise and
        anxiety, but his manner changed but little.</p>

    <p>“Where have you got him?” he asked.</p>

    <p>“Without, sir; shall I bring him here?”</p>

    <p>“Nay, I will go to him,” Carew replied, after
        an instant of thought. “Raleigh, drink thou
        the sack, I will return again;” and he followed
        the servant from the hall.</p>

    <p>Lady Carew glanced nervously across at her
        guest.</p>

    <p>“May it be trouble?” she asked in an anxious
        voice.</p>

    <p>Raleigh shook his head. “In these times
        we cannot know, madam,” he replied, “but I
        take it that Sir William stands well with the
        king’s highness and with Cromwell.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, so we believe,” she said, speaking
        low, “but which of us can know how soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
        change may come? Wolsey, More, Fisher,
        the unhappy and gracious lady at Bugden!
        Why may not my good lord be caught also in
        the toils?”</p>

    <p>A shadow crossed Raleigh’s face, but it was
        only for the moment; after it came his ready
        smile.</p>

    <p>“Madam,” he said gently, “I know not how
        it may be, but I am sure that Sir William’s
        honest heart and clean hands are truly valued
        by the king’s grace; you know the saying is
        that ‘King Harry loves a man,’ and nowhere
        in this realm will he find a more valiant soldier
        or a more honest and God-fearing gentleman
        than your husband; albeit, Sir William may—from
        his own frankness—have made some
        enemies. A great-hearted man who dealeth
        honestly is like to have them, for there be
        many who do hate the odor of the truth.”</p>

    <p>Lady Carew sighed. “It may be that my
        heart is over-anxious,” she said; “these be
        troubled times, and Sir William hath often
        told me that my outspoken sympathy with that
        good queen is like to bring him into evil
        straits.”</p>

    <p>There was no more time for the good dame’s
        fears and misgivings, for at this moment Sir
        William returned, followed by a young man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
        fine bearing, whose rich attire was besprinkled
        with mud from hard riding.</p>

    <p>“Madam, I bring you a welcome visitor,”
        Carew said briefly. “My wife and Master
        Raleigh, this is Master Simon Raby, the son
        of Lord Raby of Sussex.”</p>

    <p>The young stranger made his obeisance with
        the easy grace of a courtier, drawing near to
        the group by the fire, and at Sir William’s
        invitation laying aside his cloak and disclosing
        a gallant figure. A tall man, broad-shouldered
        enough, yet graceful, with a fine,
        frank face, which had in it the pink and white
        color of a girl’s, but bold and brave enough to
        bear this dainty touch of nature. His hair
        was chestnut color, and his dark eyes were
        keen, but with a merry glance in them. He
        wore the rich dress of the court, his velvet
        doublet slashed with satin and edged with fur,
        Flanders lace upon his ruff, and in the side of
        his velvet cap were set three crimson feathers,
        clasped with a great jewel, while his velvet
        cloak was lined with crimson sarsenet. Certainly
        a figure for the two young girls to look
        at in some amazement, being little used to
        court gallants down in Devonshire; and while
        they viewed him, no doubt approvingly but in
        discreet silence, his eyes rested in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
        wonder and manifest admiration upon the
        glowing face of Mistress Betty. All the time,
        however, he talked with Master Raleigh, while
        Lady Carew and her husband spoke apart. Sir
        William held in his hand a letter, of which
        he evidently had much to say, and both he and
        his wife glanced frequently at the two young
        maidens by the fire. At last Carew turned
        abruptly to his niece.</p>

    <p>“Betty,” he said, “what say you to a brief
        absence from home, that you may attend upon
        a great lady, who is in poor health and—unhappy,
        and so has need of your service?”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty looked up amazed, with a
        pretty deepening of the color in her cheeks,
        and it was noted that Master Raby listened to
        her answer with much attention.</p>

    <p>“I am so happy here at Mohun’s Ottery,
        good uncle,” she said, “that I love not the
        thought of quitting it; yet so deep am I in your
        debt that it is for you to direct me as you will,
        and for me to obey with love and cheerfulness.”</p>

    <p>Sir William smiled. “Wisely and modestly
        spoken, wench,” he said, “and I have so little
        wish to part with you that I would fain find
        an excuse to my lord privy seal, but there is
        none. Therefore prepare for the journey; to-morrow
        morning you will ride with me.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Mistress Betty’s bright face paled a little
        and her eyes clouded. “Where go we, uncle?”
        she asked quickly.</p>

    <p>“Of that you shall know hereafter,” he answered
        shortly, his own brow frowning slightly;
        “it is enough that you attend a noble lady by
        order of the privy seal.”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty bit her lips, casting down
        her eyes, a sudden chagrin in her manner.
        Young as she was, she had no love of orders
        that were unexplained, and Master Raby, seeing
        her expression, addressed her with a pleasant
        courtesy.</p>

    <p>“I fear your service may be sad, mistress,”
        he said gravely, “but, happily for you, it is like
        to be a short one, if rumor saith the truth.”</p>

    <p>“Is it so, indeed?” exclaimed Raleigh, a
        sorrowful surprise in his kindly face. “I heard
        it not, ere now;” for he understood the reference,
        although Betty did not.</p>

    <p>“True enough, I fear me,” Raby answered,
        “although we know it not at Greenwich.”</p>

    <p>“How goes it there?” asked Sir William,
        anxiously.</p>

    <p>“Gay, marvellously gay,” his guest replied,
        “though the king’s grace has been troubled
        with the swelling in his leg again.”</p>

    <p>At this Sir William shook his head.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“And no boy yet,” he said; “pray Heaven
        this realm may see a prince before his highness
        yields further to these troubles, and so leaves
        us with our swords at each other’s throats!”</p>

    <p>“What other tidings?” asked Raleigh,
        eagerly.</p>

    <p>“None of late importance,” Raby answered.
        “Fox has gone to talk to the Lutheran princes
        against the French intrigues; Master Latimer
        is made Bishop of Worcester; the parliament
        has passed the vagrant act, and the universities
        will pay no more tenths and first fruits; there
        has been a great mask at Greenwich and a
        wizard has come to London who promises to
        show the king his own successor, but his grace
        will none of him.”</p>

    <p>“It may be that he dreads to inquire into so
        grave a matter,” suggested Lady Carew.</p>

    <p>“I know not, madam,” answered Raby,
        smiling; “it is a much mooted question, even
        now that the little princess is proclaimed.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, but we have had already enough of
        such fancies,” retorted Carew, stoutly; “we
        have not forgot the Oxford conjurer, nor the
        prophecy that he made whereby he declared
        that none of ‘the Cadwallader blood’ should
        reign long, and would even have raised an heir
        to Lancaster from the bloody field of Tewkesbury.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
        All such matters be but the beginning
        of treason;” and the good baron turned to his
        posset in open disgust of the sorcerer’s arts.</p>

    <p>Far other thoughts ran in the mind of his
        elder guest; Raleigh sat looking at the fire
        with much perplexity upon his face.</p>

    <p>“Latimer a bishop!” he said, at last; “I
        do remember the time when they would have
        burnt him but for my lord cardinal; strange,
        too, that Wolsey’s hand should have plucked
        such a fagot from the fire. Verily, these are
        days when swift changes come upon this
        realm.”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

            <small>MISTRESS BETTY GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Under</span> a gray sky and over moors, brown
        with the frost, rode Mistress Betty Carew upon
        her first journey into the great world. She
        and her uncle were escorted by Master Raby
        and a few stout retainers, all being well armed,
        for travellers encountered some perils upon
        those lonely roads. The young girl, going out
        upon an unknown errand and feeling herself
        almost a stranger even to Sir William, spoke
        but little, her mind being full of many thoughts
        and fancies. She had as yet no intuition of
        her destination, and marvelled not a little at
        the peremptory summons coming to one so
        little known as she was. Happily for her, she
        had been bred up in the school of misfortune
        and had profited by its early and sharp lessons.
        Naturally imperious in temper, she had learned
        to submit to the inevitable, and accepted this
        sudden and unwelcome change as part of her
        uncertain destiny, knowing that her poverty
        and dependence made her a plaything in the
        hands of fate. She had learned also in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
        early school to be a close observer of men
        and women, and was not unskilful in reading
        character, although so young. Therefore she
        smiled a little when she heard her uncle’s
        sharp comment on Simon Raby’s groom.</p>

    <p>“What hangdog knave is that thou hast
        there, Raby?” Sir William asked, when they
        were leaving an inn where they had stopped
        for a few moments.</p>

    <p>“You mean not my groom surely, Sir
        William?” said Raby, smiling; “an honest
        fellow, who has served me two years or more.”</p>

    <p>“I marvel that he stayed so long out of
        gaol,” Carew answered dryly; “a crop-eared
        villain, who will hang some day at Tyburn.”</p>

    <p>The younger man laughed gayly. “A sorry
        prophecy, sir,” he said lightly; “the man has
        served me faithfully, as far as I know, and
        seems free enough of bad habits,—drinks less,
        thieves less, and quarrels less than most.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” retorted Sir William, with a grim
        smile, “he would not quarrel openly, but keep
        a knife for your back at midnight; I would give
        him short shrift if he were mine.”</p>

    <p>“Verily, I must look for another knave,”
        Raby answered, still laughing. “I shall
        scarce ride in comfort after this with the
        fellow at my heels.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Take my word for it,” Carew returned; “I
        have been magistrate and provost and chief
        executioner—as it would seem—here in
        Devon, for all things are shifted on my
        shoulders, and it is such-looking rogues as that
        one who keep the hangman from forgetting
        his trade.”</p>

    <p>“Your uncle is a hard judge, Mistress
        Carew,” Raby remarked; “I should not wish
        to stand trial at his hands unless, perchance,
        he liked my face. Here is my poor groom,
        Thaxter, already doomed to hang for his.”</p>

    <p>“To speak truth, he has an evil countenance,
        Master Raby,” she answered quietly, but with
        a smiling glance at her uncle.</p>

    <p>“You are prejudiced by Sir William,”
        Raby declared. “I am willing to wager that
        the poor fellow is as honest as many with a
        fair exterior.”</p>

    <p>“I will take the wager, Raby,” Carew remarked
        calmly, “and you will be the loser,
        therefore make it not too heavy on your purse.”</p>

    <p>“Fifty pounds, and I do not fear to lose,”
        the other cried, still much diverted by the
        matter.</p>

    <p>“I am that much a gainer,” Sir William
        said, “but I will pray you not to test the affair
        at the moment by making him our guide. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
        am not willing to trust my neck and Betty’s to
        his mercies.”</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew shall take no risks,” Raby
        replied; “you and I will settle the wager
        when we are not in so fair company. Indeed,
        I trust that we shall make this journey safely
        and with expedition, since my lord privy seal
        was urgent that the matter should be speedily
        accomplished.”</p>

    <p>“Will they be ready for our reception?
        Has yonder lady been notified, or is this the
        act of Cromwell only?” Carew asked gravely.</p>

    <p>Raby shook his head. “I know not,” he
        answered. “I am but the bearer of certain
        instructions, but I fear that the—that her
        grace is little consulted in the affair.”</p>

    <p>Carew did not reply, but seemed to muse
        over some grave subject, for his face became
        almost stern in its repose; and Raby, seeing
        his preoccupation, took his place at Mistress
        Betty’s bridle, guiding her horse and talking
        lightly and pleasantly of those matters that he
        thought would amuse his young companion.
        He had been but lately at the court, and told
        her of the jousts at Greenwich, when the
        knights tilted before Queen Anne Boleyn.</p>

    <p>“It was a beautiful sight,” he said; “they
        wore white velvet, embroidered in silver, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
        the lists were surrounded by the gayest ladies
        of the court; there was a sheen of gold brocade,
        and jewels; it was a scene worth seeing,
        and ’twill be remembered long by those who
        saw it.”</p>

    <p>“And the queen?” Betty asked, with a
        little hesitation, “is the queen as beautiful as
        they say?”</p>

    <p>“She was thought to be the most beautiful
        woman at court when she was Marchioness of
        Pembroke,” Raby answered; “and she is still
        fair to look upon, though I do think that there
        are others more lovely. I doubt not she would
        call it treason did she hear me say it,” he
        added, smiling.</p>

    <p>“I should like to see her,” Mistress Carew
        said thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>“You have no need to seek so far to find a
        fairer face,” Raby answered, with the gallantry
        of a courtier.</p>

    <p>And so they rode on, talking in a friendly
        way until they seemed no longer strangers,
        and were but little interrupted by Sir William,
        who was wrapped in his own thoughts, which
        were apparently not altogether pleasant ones.
        Thus the three made the journey together,
        and still Betty knew nothing of her destination,
        though she marvelled more and more as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
        the way lengthened, and they stopped at first
        one tavern and then another. But in those
        days young girls were little considered and
        were expected to submit, with implicit obedience,
        to the guidance of their elders. More
        than once Betty thought that she was likely to
        come to her journey’s end without knowing
        her errand, but it was not to be so. The last
        day of her travels brought her enlightenment.
        Toward evening, when they were riding along
        at an even gait and had just passed through a
        small village, Master Raby fell back, leaving
        uncle and niece alone, as though he gave them
        opportunity for a last talk together, and Sir
        William, almost at once, availed himself
        of it.</p>

    <p>“Fair niece,” he said, “you are truly a jewel
        among women, for you have not yet asked me
        a question. Did your aunt tell you whither
        you were bound?”</p>

    <p>“Nay, uncle,” Mistress Betty answered
        quietly, “but I remember my cause for
        gratitude and am willing to do your bidding,
        though I should like to know where we are
        going.”</p>

    <p>Carew smiled. “There spoke the woman,”
        he said, “yet I fear you will be little pleased;
        it is no lively errand for a girl. We are riding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
        to Kimbolton, where they have but lately
        taken the princess dowager.”</p>

    <p>“What, sir, do I go to the queen?” cried
        Betty, in amazement.</p>

    <p>“Mind thy tongue, young mistress,” Carew
        said sharply; “not queen, but princess
        dowager.”</p>

    <p>“You mean Queen Catherine, uncle,” Betty
        retorted, some excitement in her voice; “I
        cannot think of her as less than the queen.”</p>

    <p>“Then must you learn to speedily,” Sir
        William said, “for you are sent down to Kimbolton
        by my lord privy seal, and you must not
        transgress the king’s commandment in this
        matter, whereby we are bidden to hold this
        lady as only the widow of Prince Arthur.”</p>

    <p>“I cannot see how that may be,” the young
        girl cried; “she was surely the king’s wife,
        and there be many who declare that there is
        no divorcement.”</p>

    <p>“But ye are not of them, wench,” her uncle
        said sternly; “his grace of Canterbury hath
        declared the king’s first marriage null, and we
        have naught to do with the opinions of the
        Bishop of Rome, albeit this lady clings to his
        judgment and will none of the king’s.”</p>

    <p>“Uncle, do you believe that she is fairly
        used?” asked Mistress Betty, with the fearful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
        honesty of youth; “think you they had a right
        to treat the daughter of a king with such
        contumely?”</p>

    <p>“’Tis not for you to ask, or for me to
        answer, niece,” Sir William answered sharply;
        “it is done, and the Act of the Succession
        hath set aside the Lady Mary. Mind, therefore,
        that you fall into no error in these
        matters, but do your duty, leaving these questions
        to the bishops and the king’s grace.”</p>

    <p>“But wherefore do they send me thither?”
        she asked, her voice betraying her discontent;
        “what need is there for me?”</p>

    <p>“Now listen well to me, Betty,” her uncle
        said sternly; “you are young to be sent on
        such an errand. The princess has been surrounded
        only with her own creatures, there has
        been some plotting, and my lord privy seal
        would have one woman there who, being not of
        it, will be a check upon them; and he sent to
        me, because he puts some confidence in me,
        and was recommended, too, by our kinsman,
        the master of horse, Sir Nicholas Carew.”</p>

    <p>For a moment there was silence, and then
        Betty spoke with passionate feeling.</p>

    <p>“See you not, uncle, that they would make a
        spy of me?” she cried; “how can you bear that
        this should be? Surely you are too honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
        to see your niece sent to watch and betray a
        noble and an injured princess!”</p>

    <p>“Hark ye, fair niece!” said Sir William, in
        a low tone, “I am not without sympathy for
        yonder great lady; she has been hardly used,
        though it is my peril to say so, and if you go
        not to her, my lord privy seal will surely send
        another who may, being tempted, work some
        deep mischief to her. See ye not how grievously
        an enemy might hurt her?”</p>

    <p>“I see, I see,” Betty answered, “yet I can
        never play the part of a spy!”</p>

    <p>“Nor did I ask you, wench,” Carew answered
        grimly. “I would wring your neck
        with my own hand, thought I you were so
        mean a traitress. But remember that you owe
        allegiance to the king’s grace and you cannot
        break it without as great dishonor. Let not
        soft words prevail with you. It is commonly
        reported that this poor lady is plotting mischief
        with the Emperor of Germany and the
        Bishop of Rome. Not that I greatly blame
        her, Heaven knows, but it is a damnable
        treason against this realm and is like to pull
        us all by the pates if it succeeds. Meddle not
        with it, bear no secret messages, open no
        barred doors, steal no keys, though the lack of
        them may lay a royal head upon the block.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
        Remember your allegiance, do your duty and
        leave the rest to wiser brains than yours.”</p>

    <p>“That will I promise to do right cheerfully,”
        Betty answered, “but never could I betray a
        woman in so sad a case.”</p>

    <p>“It is well,” Sir William said soberly; “do
        your duty and mind well your tongue, for it
        may be that there will be some who would
        right willingly set a snare for you to bring you
        to disaster and work my downfall. I know
        not how close an eye Cromwell hath upon me,
        nor how he means to try me withal. He is a
        cat who plays with many mice, and his trap is
        the Tower.”</p>

    <p>“Hast thou then so many enemies, uncle?”
        Betty asked, in some wonder.</p>

    <p>“Enough and to spare, fair niece,” he answered;
        “and there is much malice in a court:
        it crawleth, like the serpent, on its belly, and
        there is war between it and the seed of woman,
        for it ever stings the heel of him who would
        live honestly. It was such malice that pulled
        down my lord cardinal. But enough; you
        know your duty, and yonder is Kimbolton.”</p>

            <small>THE QUEEN AT KIMBOLTON</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">The</span> shadows of evening were gathering fast
        when the little party halted at the gates of
        Kimbolton. There was much parley, and the
        royal warrant was produced before the visitors
        were admitted, the delay and formality impressing
        Betty with the feeling of entering a
        prison; and she followed her uncle reluctantly
        across the courtyard, where a few torches flared
        in the gloom. No womanish qualms, however,
        oppressed Carew, and he walked boldly forward,
        leaving Raby to attend upon his niece,
        an office which the younger man eagerly
        accepted; indeed, he had already won the good
        opinion of Mistress Betty by his courtly gallantry
        upon the road. Bred in the country
        and under unfortunate auspices, she was little
        accustomed to the attendance of a courtier,
        and she noted young Master Raby’s courtesy
        and graceful tact with some secret admiration,
        though she held her head high and was, as
        usual, chary of her smiles, perhaps, because—like
        every beauty—she knew their value.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
        Unfavorably impressed both with the place
        and with the lack of state and hospitality, she
        shrank back a little, and so it was that she and
        her cavalier were late in entering the hall, and
        found Sir William already in deep converse
        with the castellan, Sir Edmund Bedingfield.
        Neither of these worthies heeded the young
        people, scarcely noting their entrance, but
        stood talking and perusing a letter, no doubt
        the instructions of my lord privy seal. Mistress
        Betty and Raby drew near to the fire in
        the great chimney, a pile of logs of such
        length that one end might burn while the
        other was cold, but giving little warmth, for
        the opening above was of such huge dimensions
        that gusts of cold air came down with greater
        alacrity than the sparks and smoke went up.
        There was a lack of due attendance, a cheerless
        and gloomy aspect that increased the young
        girl’s unfavorable impression, and she shivered
        a little, bending over the fire and holding out
        her hands to the blaze.</p>

    <p>“A dull place,” said Simon Raby, in a low
        tone; “a dull place for an uncrowned queen.”</p>

    <p>“Poor lady!” murmured Betty, forgetful of
        her uncle’s recent instructions, “’tis enough
        to break her heart.”</p>

    <p>“I never knew her,” Raby answered. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
        was away in France with Sir John Wallop
        until the queen that now is was crowned, but
        they do tell me that this lady is too strong and
        resolute a woman to greatly mourn the loss
        of state or earthly glory; but ’tis awful to
        consign a princess to so mean a case as
        this.”</p>

    <p>Betty, remembering now the commands that
        were laid upon her, turned the subject without
        an open expression of her own feeling on this
        point.</p>

    <p>“You were in France?” she said; “’tis
        there my cousin Peter is; he ran away, you
        know, and coming to Paris, was taken into the
        household of Sir John Wallop.”</p>

    <p>“I know him,” her companion answered,
        smiling; “a gay and fiery gallant, who is like
        to make a brave record for Mohun’s Ottery.”</p>

    <p>At this moment they were interrupted by
        Bedingfield, who, turning from Sir William,
        for the first time cast a glance in Betty’s
        direction.</p>

    <p>“Is this the maid?” he asked.</p>

    <p>“Come hither, niece,” Carew said, “and
        make your curtsy to Sir Edmund; you are
        now committed to his charge to be introduced
        to the princess dowager.”</p>

    <p>“Who is little likely to be pleased thereat,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
        remarked Bedingfield, with a frankness which
        yet farther chilled Betty’s heart. “I bid you
        welcome, mistress,” he added dryly; “it is a
        sorry place for a young maid at best, and of
        late her highness has been ailing and in no
        plight to crave gay attendance.”</p>

    <p>“Discourage her no more, Bedingfield,” Sir
        William remarked; “the wench is sufficiently
        cast down at the prospect, without your croaking
        talk.”</p>

    <p>“It mends not a matter to dress it in gay
        colors,” Bedingfield retorted briefly. “Come,
        young mistress, follow me to the princess;
        there is no place to bestow you until I know
        her wishes, and ’tis best to cut a long matter
        short.”</p>

    <p>“I would make some changes in my garments,”
        Mistress Betty said quietly, “before I
        go to—to her grace.”</p>

    <p>“There is no need,” Sir Edmund replied,
        with evident impatience to have an unpleasant
        task accomplished; “you may lay aside your
        cloak in the antechamber while I learn her
        highness’s wishes in the matter, and so end it.”</p>

    <p>Without more words, he turned to the staircase
        and began the ascent, and after one glance
        at her uncle to ascertain his wishes, Betty followed
        with a heavy heart. She was not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
        a little thrill of excitement at the thought
        of seeing this unhappy queen, and there was,
        too, all a young girl’s curiosity and eagerness
        for adventure, but she dreaded a cold reception,
        knowing so well how unwelcome she was
        likely to be, sent, as she was, by one whom
        the poor woman must regard as her greatest
        enemy. So in a tumult of contrary emotions
        Mistress Betty walked down the gloomy, ill-lighted
        corridor, behind the castellan, mentally
        contrasting this dull place with Mohun’s
        Ottery. They were not to gain admittance
        without some parley; the queen allowed no
        intercourse with the royal officers stationed
        about her by the king. She lived among her
        own people, and Bedingfield had to crave permission
        to speak with her. Finally, a page
        admitted them into a small anteroom, where
        Betty was told to wait and lay aside her
        mantle. There was a closed door opposite to
        the one at which they had entered, and from
        behind it came the sound of voices engaged in
        conversation, which was hushed as Bedingfield
        opened the door and passed through. Betty
        knew that he was going into the presence of
        the queen, and she stood listening with anxiety.
        She heard a woman’s voice address him at
        once; the cold dignity of the tone and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
        slightly foreign accent made her sure of the
        identity of the speaker.</p>

    <p>“What tidings, Sir Edmund?” she asked;
        “my maids tell me there is a stir below, and
        truly we long for any change; ay, almost welcome
        evil rather than the dull monotony of
        suspense.”</p>

    <p>“No news, madam,” replied Bedingfield;
        “only a messenger from my lord privy seal
        and—”</p>

    <p>“Alack, alack!” cried Catherine, hastily,
        “I did not speak sooth; news from that quarter
        is ill news indeed. If it had been from the
        king’s highness—but that comes no more to
        me.”</p>

    <p>“In a way it is, madam,” Sir Edmund answered;
        “the king’s grace hath sent another
        maid to attend upon your highness.”</p>

    <p>“Another maid!” the queen exclaimed, in
        a tone of irony; “you mock me, sir; ’tis not
        possible that so great state is allowed the
        Queen of England? Four maids! Such a
        train will be a grievous charge upon you.”</p>

    <p>“Nay, madam, I do beseech you, lay not
        the blame of your poor attendance upon me,”
        Bedingfield said, with some feeling; “I may
        not exceed my orders.”</p>

    <p>“Your orders,” said the queen, bitterly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
        “who gave them to you, man, but that tailor’s
        son, mine enemy?”</p>

    <p>“Nay, madam; you do wrong my lord privy
        seal,” Bedingfield returned; “he is but the
        mouthpiece of the king’s grace.”</p>

    <p>“It may be, and it should not be,” Catherine
        said sadly; “yet the time may come when
        even Cromwell will regret it. I do remember
        that my lord cardinal wrought against me to
        his own downfall, and died loving me, as I
        believe, better than his creature, who still
        wears a paper crown.”</p>

    <p>There was a moment’s pause, and then Bedingfield
        spoke abruptly.</p>

    <p>“I would know your highness’s pleasure in
        regard to the maid who waits without.”</p>

    <p>“The maid!—what maid?” exclaimed Catherine,
        as if awakened from a dream; “oh, ay,
        I do remember! Why, send her to me, sir; I
        fear her not, even though she be a spy of my
        lord privy seal. If she has a woman’s heart,
        doubtless it will be moved to see her queen
        brought to so low estate; and if she has no
        heart, then will I rejoice that mine enemies
        may have a true report of how chastely and
        honorably the Queen of England bears herself
        under the deepest injury that a woman and a
        wife can suffer.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Do I understand that your grace will see
        the maid to-night?” Bedingfield asked dryly.</p>

    <p>“When it be your pleasure, sir,” the
        queen answered coldly; “a prisoner hath
        no choice.”</p>

    <p>“Nay, madam,” Bedingfield began haughtily,
        “I—”</p>

    <p>“Send her, sir,” exclaimed the queen,
        sharply; “I would see her now! I am weary,
        and words mend not my case; let us so end
        the matter.”</p>

    <p>“As you will, madam,” the castellan replied;
        “I do but my duty.”</p>

    <p>“I doubt it not, good Bedingfield,” she answered
        with sad courtesy, “but I have known
        duty more graciously done. Howbeit, send
        me the maid; I would see what sort of a
        creature my Lord Cromwell sends to watch
        his queen.”</p>

    <p>“Your grace mistakes the matter,” Sir
        Edmund said awkwardly; “this is a well-bred
        maiden, the niece of a gallant gentleman of
        Devon, Sir William Carew.”</p>

    <p>“Carew?” repeated the queen, thoughtfully.
        “I should know the name, kindred of the
        master of horse, as I remember, and he is truly
        a noble soldier. Fate and Cromwell are propitious;
        I looked for worse. Let there be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
        more delay, sir; my heart fluttereth at the
        thought of four female attendants,” she added,
        with a touch of irony.</p>

    <p>Having overheard all this talk, so little
        calculated to allay her misgivings, Betty waited
        for Bedingfield’s summons with increased
        agitation. When he came to the door and
        beckoned to her to advance, she did so with
        great reluctance; although never a timid girl,
        she felt deeply embarrassed as she entered the
        room beyond, and found herself in the presence
        of Catherine of Arragon. Her eyes dazzled
        by the greater illumination, she was, at first,
        only conscious that she stood in a large room
        where there was a bright fire burning on the
        hearth, and before it several figures. She
        made her curtsy almost mechanically, and it
        was a moment before she collected her thoughts,
        and then she found that the queen was addressing
        her.</p>

    <p>“I bid you welcome, maiden,” Catherine
        said not unkindly. “Sir Edmund tells me
        that you are sent by my lord privy seal, whereby
        I know you to be chosen rather to his liking
        than my own comfort; but God forbid that I
        should misjudge so young a heart as thine!
        What is your name?”</p>

    <p>“Betty Carew,” was the answer, in a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
        tone, “the daughter of Sir Thomas Carew of
        Devon.”</p>

    <p>“Thomas Carew,” repeated the queen, with
        sudden recollection. “Your mother was the
        daughter of Lord Penrith; I knew her well,
        and I do now recall that she commended her
        child to my care, when I was little able to care
        for any one; a falling tree doth crush the
        flower at its root. Blessed Virgin, how strange
        is destiny! That very child sent down to
        watch her royal mistress!”</p>

    <p>Catherine spoke in a low tone, more to herself
        than to those about her, and sat for a few
        moments lost in revery. She was seated in a
        great chair before the hearth, and there was
        much calm dignity and sadness in her whole
        aspect, but she was both unlovely and unattractive;
        a stout woman with a pale, large-featured
        face which ill health and trouble had
        aged before her time. Her expression was
        austere, and there were traces of deep sorrow
        and anxiety in the furrows that already marked
        her brow and the deep purple shadows under her
        dark eyes. Her gown was of black velvet, with
        large, flowing sleeves over small, straight ones,
        which had lace ruffles over the hands. On her
        head was a high, crownlike, five-cornered cap
        edged with jewels, two pieces falling down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
        from it over the ears, and at the back was fastened
        the Spanish mantilla, its graceful folds
        draping her shoulders and showing her face in
        strong relief against the black background.
        Behind her chair were grouped three ladies-in-waiting,
        and all bent curious glances on the
        young stranger. Mistress Betty’s blooming
        youth and brilliantly colored beauty had never
        shown to a more dazzling advantage than it did
        by contrast now, and Catherine herself, looking
        up from her revery, observed it and smiled
        sadly.</p>

    <p>“Alas!” she said, “poor maid, this place is
        like to be no better than a tomb to one so
        young, albeit safer for your soul’s grace now
        than Greenwich. I have no entertainment, no
        masks, no dances to break the cold monotony.
        You may pray here, weep here, die here, but
        verily, you will have no revelry. If you but
        remember to be a woman, and bear a woman’s
        heart in your breast, as did your mother, you
        will find me no unkind mistress to you, though,
        God knows, an impoverished one. Wilt serve
        me on such terms as these?”</p>

    <p>“Madam, I will do my duty, and I can no
        more,” Betty answered in a low tone, divided
        between her pity and her uncle’s instructions.</p>

    <p>The queen smiled ironically. “Well tutored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
        in her ‘duty,’ doubtless,” she said, turning to
        her maids; “a cautious answer, aptly mouthed.
        But, pshaw! I grow a weak woman to be angered
        with a baby. The wench is tired, I know;
        these men take no thought for a woman’s
        strength, and doubtless she has ridden long and
        far. Take her away and find some place to
        bestow her, and to-morrow we will give some
        employment to her. Can you sing, Mistress
        Carew?” she added to Betty.</p>

    <p>“I can both sing and play upon the harp,
        madam,” the young girl answered gravely, for
        Catherine’s words offended her, even though
        she felt the justice of the queen’s suspicions.</p>

    <p>“A musician,” said Catherine, more graciously;
        “now am I reconciled. Like Saul,
        my soul finds consolation in music; it seems
        my lord privy seal would send me a female
        David! Well, well, leave me, maiden; I am
        weary, and I would not have you think your
        queen a sour and uncharitable woman with no
        lenient word for youth. Go eat and sleep, and
        to-morrow we will be merry.”</p>

            <small>THE GENTLEMAN IN THE RUSSET CLOAK</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Queen Catherine’s</span> prediction that life at
        Kimbolton would be gloomy for a young girl,
        seemed likely to be fulfilled. Happily, for
        Mistress Betty’s comfort, she had already
        undergone such discipline in both poverty and
        solitude that she was better fitted to endure
        restraint and depressing surroundings than
        others of her years. Sir William Carew and
        Master Raby bade her farewell the morning
        after her arrival, and from that time she encountered
        no very friendly treatment, except
        from Sir Edmund Bedingfield. The queen
        was never unkind, but she looked upon Betty
        with suspicion, and a settled conviction existed
        in her mind that the young girl was a spy of
        my lord privy seal, while her three attendants,
        all women who were devoted to her person,
        resented still more intensely the presence of
        the new lady-in-waiting. At the same time,
        Betty’s youth, beauty, and many attractions
        won upon them, in spite of themselves, and
        they could not be harsh or malicious to so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
        charming a creature. After the first week or
        two they relaxed a little in their manner toward
        her, and gradually she won her own place in
        the little household, though she was never
        trusted in any confidential matter; and often,
        at her approach, conversation was hushed or
        writing materials put aside, and an artificial
        manner assumed, as before a stranger. Intensely
        as Betty resented the distrust and
        coldness, she was not without a feeling of
        thankfulness that her sympathies would never
        be appealed to, that they seemed to have no
        wish to work upon her for any of their secret
        purposes. That there was much scheming
        she could not doubt from many little indications,
        and from occasional passages in the conversation,
        she learned that Catherine was still
        industriously employed in appealing both to
        the Emperor Charles and to the new pope. To
        all these matters Betty tried to close her eyes
        and ears, and indeed it seemed to her that it
        could not last long; it required no very observant
        eye to see that the queen was suffering
        from some malady even more dangerous than
        grief and mortification. There were many
        days when the royal sufferer never left her bed,
        and at such times she seemed to find genuine
        consolation in Betty’s harp and her clear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
        sweet voice. The young girl, moved by deep
        pity for the injured queen, was ever ready to
        give her the comfort of her music, and so,
        little by little, she gained a place in Catherine’s
        regard, though herself chilled and sometimes
        repulsed by the coldness and suspicious
        austerity of the Castilian princess. Just, virtuous,
        and religious, Catherine did not also
        possess the attraction of sweet and gracious
        manners, and her natural austerity had been
        increased by the usage she had received in
        England. She was devout in the observance
        of her religion, rising at five o’clock in the
        morning for prayers, and fasting with rigid
        exactness. Beneath her robes she had always
        worn the habit of a nun of the order of Saint
        Francis, and she held the vanities of the world
        in contempt, even while she contended for her
        earthly honors. Heavily oppressed by her sorrows
        and deeply distressed for the future of her
        daughter, the unhappy queen had neither leisure
        nor inclination to win the affection of the
        young attendant so unceremoniously thrust upon
        her. So it was that Mistress Betty stood as one
        apart, and watched the sad little drama to its
        close without feeling herself one of the actors.</p>

    <p>Catherine held a little court each day, unless
        her health prevented it, many visitors coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
        and going at Kimbolton in spite of the surveillance
        of the royal officers. Although he feared
        her influence, the king had never isolated her;
        he either respected her too much, or hesitated
        because of the popular feeling in her favor,
        and the attitude of the foreign princes. She
        was in the hands of the officers of the crown,
        but they dared not treat her as a prisoner, and
        the sympathy of a large portion of the kingdom
        showed itself, more or less openly, in many
        ways. Yet life at Kimbolton was gloomy
        enough, and the queen being almost constantly
        indisposed, her maids had small opportunities
        for out-of-door exercises and none for sports.
        Their greatest entertainment was to embroider
        in the evenings, gathered about the invalid’s
        chair, or to play cards,—a game in which the
        queen sometimes joined, though it was whispered
        among her women that she had hated
        the sight of a card since she had played with
        Anne Boleyn at Greenwich. Although Betty
        felt herself an object of indifference to the
        little circle, she was more noticed and commented
        upon than she was aware. The fresh
        beauty of the young girl was often the subject
        of conversation, when her back was turned;
        even the queen observing it and speaking of
        Betty’s many charms.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“A fair face,” she said to her attendants,
        “and a soft voice; ’tis a pity if both are
        false.”</p>

    <p>“I cannot think so, madam,” one of the
        older women replied; “the child has a candid
        eye and an upright conduct that denies all
        secret dealings.”</p>

    <p>“It should be so,” Catherine remarked sadly.
        “I knew her mother, a very honest woman, but
        she is long dead, and how shall we know how
        they bring up our children? Alas! when I
        think of the Princess Mary, my heart bleeds.
        I, too, am led to think well of this little
        maid, yet I never knew my lord privy seal
        to send a lamb into my fold to comfort me
        withal.”</p>

    <p>“It may be he has mistaken his choice,
        madam,” her woman answered; “there be
        more people for your grace than against you;
        yea, more than half this kingdom.”</p>

    <p>“It may be,” the queen replied; “I will so
        believe it. Truly, I hate to look with suspicion
        on so fair a face, yet I know one fair
        face that hideth a false heart. But all women
        are not harlots, thanks be to the Virgin! This
        young girl tells me she has never been to
        court, never seen a joust, never joined the gay
        revellers at a mask. Doubtless her uncle will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
        take her presently to curtsy to that woman
        whom they call the queen, the true queen being
        not dead, albeit like to die. Mistress Carew
        will make a fair figure at the court, fairer than
        many, say you not so, Patience?”</p>

    <p>“Ay, gracious Queen,” Patience answered,
        eagerly catching the drift of her royal mistress’s
        thoughts, “I know none fairer; she is
        so tall and straight and withal so beautifully
        moulded. Not lean and long, but round and
        supple; and her skin is dazzling when the
        color comes, while those brown eyes of hers
        are two shining lights, and she has a mouth
        like Cupid’s bow.”</p>

    <p>“Truly, you have drawn a picture that might
        delight a lover,” Catherine said, smiling; “the
        court is a dangerous place to show such
        charms. What think you, my girls, is she not
        fairer than one Anne?”</p>

    <p>“A hundred times,” they answered gladly,
        ever willing to humor their unhappy mistress.</p>

    <p>For a moment the queen did not reply; she
        sat looking before her with an ironical smile
        playing about her lips.</p>

    <p>“’Tis a pity to mew up such a beauty at
        Kimbolton,” she said at last. “Ah, if we
        could but get my lord privy seal to take her to
        the court, then might we see if the star that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
        shineth there is fixed, or but trembles to its
        fall. Alas!” she continued, after a moment,
        rousing herself from her mood, “how captivity
        and misfortune sour the temper! My thoughts
        were most unworthy and unqueenly. I may
        well let that poor creature rush to her certain
        doom unmolested by any ill-will of mine; a
        crown so ravished must press with thorns upon
        the wearer’s brow.”</p>

    <p>Unconscious both of their admiration and
        their talk of her, Mistress Betty went her way
        among them, the gloomy experience telling in
        a manner upon her life and character, teaching
        her alike to repress her natural feelings
        and to endure suspicion without openly expressing
        her indignation. The last was no easy
        matter, for she had a high temper and a passionate
        resentment of injustice. Her only
        comfort was the privilege she enjoyed of long
        rides with Sir Edmund Bedingfield. Knowing
        her uncle, and trusting her where he would not
        have dared to trust the queen’s older attendants,
        he gave her more license. Finding that
        she rode well and loved to be on a fine horse’s
        back, having inherited her father’s appreciation
        of a good animal, Bedingfield permitted
        her to accompany his party when he made
        excursions in the neighborhood. And so it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
        was that, by a chance, Mistress Carew made
        the acquaintance of a person who was to play
        no unimportant part in her life. Accompanied
        by her woman and two stout grooms, she had
        been out with Sir Edmund upon an errand in
        the country near Kimbolton. Returning at
        noonday, they drew rein at the Inn of the Sign
        of the Blue Boar, where Bedingfield and his
        two male attendants dismounted and went into
        the tavern, Sir Edmund for some information,
        and the two men for liquor. Betty and her
        woman waited without, and as they were
        detained a little while, there was ample opportunity
        to look about them. It being noonday,
        the courtyard of the Blue Boar was full of
        horses, tied and awaiting their masters, who
        were eating and drinking within. A few idle
        grooms lounged near the stables, waiting to
        earn a guerdon from a new arrival, and in the
        window of the kitchen leaned two or three
        rosy-faced maids gazing out at the scene.
        Betty’s horse, a restive creature, stood out
        upon the road at the gate, and being occupied
        with her own thoughts, she let the reins lie
        slack upon his neck, although she knew his
        spirit. Suddenly there was the sound of a
        horse’s hoofs upon the road behind her, coming
        at a gallop, and she turned her head to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
        observe the new arrival. As she did so, a
        piebald horse with a darkly cloaked rider on
        his back came dashing past her. She had no
        time for observation; her own animal plunged
        so wildly that she nearly lost her seat, and
        kept it only by virtue of her early training.
        So strange was the encounter that she was
        almost certain that the new-comer cut her horse
        with his whip as he passed. How it was, she
        could not tell, except that her gallant black
        was off at a gallop, and she could scarcely have
        curbed him but for the interference of the
        rider of the piebald steed. He dashed along
        the road, riding across her path, and with wonderful
        dexterity caught her bridle rein, halting
        the runaway. Coming thus to a standstill,
        some twenty yards from the inn, Betty found
        herself face to face with the stranger, while
        behind them there was a great commotion, all
        the visitors at the tavern having run out to
        witness what they expected would be an accident.
        Intensely angry and with scarlet cheeks,
        Mistress Betty gazed haughtily at the cause of
        her misadventure. The rider of the piebald
        was a man far below average size, thin and
        wiry, with a small, dark face, grizzled hair and
        mustaches, and eyes of such keenness and so
        intensely black that they startled the observer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
        saving their owner from any charge of insignificance.
        Insignificant he was not, in spite
        of his small stature and his plain garments,
        which were russet in color from his high riding-boots
        to his cloak, which he wore after the
        fashion of the Spaniards. Encountering now
        Mistress Carew’s indignant gaze, he took off
        his hat with elaborate courtesy and congratulated
        her on her safety as if he were unconscious
        of having had any part in the matter.</p>

    <p>“It was fortunate that I came at the moment,
        fair mistress,” he said; and she noticed that he
        had a singular but not unpleasant voice. “You
        are riding too spirited an animal for a lady;
        let me recommend a gentler one to Sir
        Edmund.”</p>

    <p>Betty started at the mention of Bedingfield’s
        name, but recollecting how well he was known
        in the neighborhood of Kimbolton, she thought
        it but folly to be surprised that the stranger
        knew to whose party she belonged.</p>

    <p>“I thank you, sir,” she said, a little curtly;
        “the horse has never acted so before unless
        switched, and, indeed, I do not think he would
        have run had you ridden at a more moderate
        pace.”</p>

    <p>“I grieve to think myself the cause of your
        discomfort, madam,” the stranger replied, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
        with an amused smile. “Jack Kotch and I
        never go slow,” he added, turning his horse,
        and, to her annoyance, keeping at Betty’s rein
        as she went toward the inn.</p>

    <p>“It is ill judged to run a horse so close to
        one standing as mine was,” she said, still too
        angry to let the matter pass.</p>

    <p>“It is, and I crave your pardon,” the other
        rejoined cheerfully; “another time I will bring
        my horse to a walk, Mistress Carew.”</p>

    <p>Betty looked up amazed at hearing her own
        name, and encountered the stranger’s wonderful
        eyes with a gleam of amusement in them.</p>

    <p>Bedingfield, who had mounted in the interval,
        now rode up, and the little adventure had to
        be explained to him. He, seeing only ready
        courage and dexterity in the conduct of the
        new-comer, was cordial in his thanks, and even
        permitted this strange person to ride back with
        the party toward Kimbolton. This seemed to
        be the opportunity that the little man desired,
        and he was soon engaged in earnest conversation
        with Sir Edmund. So entertaining did
        he make himself that Bedingfield, to Betty’s
        surprise, invited him to come in to rest when
        they reached the castle. Usually, all visitors
        underwent a severe scrutiny on account of the
        presence of the queen, but this stranger seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
        to have overcome the castellan’s scruples and
        the piebald horse was led to the stables, while
        the rider, smaller than ever now he was dismounted,
        followed Sir Edmund into the hall.
        Betty’s mind still rankling with the belief that
        her horse had been cut with the whip of the
        piebald’s master, and her curiosity piqued by
        the little man’s appearance, she asked the
        woman with her if she had ever seen him
        before. They were going up the stairs from
        the hall, Sir Edmund and his guest standing
        by the table below, and at the question the
        woman, a servant at Kimbolton, drew nearer
        and plucked her dress with nervous fingers.</p>

    <p>“Hist, mistress!” she exclaimed in a low
        tone, “his ears are long. I have seen him but
        once before, but I know him full well; it is
        the famous wizard.”</p>

    <p>“A wizard! that little bandy-legged man a
        wizard?” Betty cried, amazed.</p>

    <p>“Hush!” said the woman, her dull face full
        of fear, “he reads your thoughts, he sees
        visions. ’Tis said that he did see, in a dream,
        Richard Rouse put the poison in my lord of
        Rochester’s bran meal at Lambeth Marsh, and
        that he had warned Richard, seven years before,
        that he would be boiled alive at Smithfield, as
        he was. I would not offend that little gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
        in the russet cloak for a kingdom; no, not
        I! They do say that his piebald horse was a
        good bay, until he waved a striped wand over
        him, at which the horse sneezed three times
        and eftsoons came out white with three bay
        spots upon him. ’Tis my belief that this same
        wizard is allied with Satan, and so think many
        honest folk. Avoid him, mistress, and you
        love your life!”</p>

            <small>THE WIZARD’S VISIT</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">In</span> their gloomy rooms Queen Catherine and
        her maids sat working when Mistress Betty
        entered, rosy from her ride and the excitement
        of her adventure, which promised now to be of
        some interest. The queen, glancing up at her
        entrance, caught the glow in the new-comer’s
        face and smiled more pleasantly than usual.</p>

    <p>“How wonderfully freedom and exercise
        affect young blood!” she said; “the wench is
        blooming as a Christmas rose. Come hither,
        my girl, and tell us of your ride; perchance it
        may seem like the recital of a chapter of wild
        adventures to us. Youth and hope see all
        things in a golden light; what knight rode
        at your bridle rein? what dragon was slain
        at your approach? Such faces as yours open
        new channels of chivalry in the hearts of
        men. Saw you not some marvel that may
        serve to cheer us in our solitude?”</p>

    <p>“Nay, madam,” Betty replied, smiling, “I
        met with no such wonders; but I did see a
        wizard riding on a piebald horse.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“A wizard on a piebald horse?” repeated
        Catherine; “’tis well, so you saw not Death
        riding on a white one, as they say my lord of
        Buckingham did once. How knew you the
        gentleman for a wizard? Did he carry the symbols
        of his trade displayed, or had he a terrible
        learned countenance that confounded all men
        at the view?”</p>

    <p>“Your grace should see what a small, bandy-legged
        creature it is, much like a frog,” said
        Mistress Carew, “only that he wears russet
        instead of green, and has a smooth tongue, so
        that even now he wins the regard of Sir
        Edmund.”</p>

    <p>“What, is he here?” exclaimed the queen,
        in surprise; “I knew not that Bedingfield
        would admit any one without the warrant of
        my lord privy seal; surely, Cromwell hath not
        sent a sorcerer to conjure me,” she added with
        an ironical laugh.</p>

    <p>“Rode he a piebald horse?” asked Patience,
        the queen’s woman; “I think I cannot mistake
        the man.”</p>

    <p>“A piebald horse, surely,” answered Betty
        Carew, “and he is clad in russet from top to
        toe; his cloak is of velvet, but his doublet, I
        think, was no more than sarsenet, and he wears
        one straight black feather in the front of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
        low hat. His eyes are bright—the brightest
        that I ever saw—and he has a pointed gray
        beard, after the fashion of the Spaniards. I
        noticed, too, that his eyebrows were arched up
        sharply, almost in a point, which gave him a
        strange look, like an owl.”</p>

    <p>“’Tis Zachary Sanders,” exclaimed Patience.
        “Your highness does remember, surely; ’tis
        he who made the wonderful ring for my lord
        cardinal and sent the scroll of her horoscope to
        the Princess Mary.”</p>

    <p>“I do seem to remember,” the queen said
        musingly, “but it is strange I do. Like a
        great sea, raging and terrible, the waters of
        Marah have overwhelmed me, sweeping on
        every side in a mighty torrent, carrying away
        all my strong friends and steadfast helpers. As
        the ocean, overflowing its borders, sweeps high
        upon the land, and when its tide recedes,
        carries away all the habitations that man has
        built upon the sand, and there is no remnant
        left thereof to tell the tale of the disaster, so
        the tide of my sorrow hath carried all things
        from my memory, stripping the beach of my
        mind and leaving only wreckage where once
        were lovely mansions of thought and fancy.
        Yet, as the saints bear witness, I did build my
        hope upon rock and looked steadfastly for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
        fulfilment. Alas, alas!” she added, tears
        shining in her eyes, “the tides have beaten on
        it, and only the sure anchor of my hope in
        heaven doth endure.”</p>

    <p>“Nay, nay, madam,” her woman cried, “speak
        not so disconsolately; the emperor bears up
        your just quarrel, and the new pope has
        declared for your cause. Look rather at the
        good hope you have in the love your people
        bear you and your fair daughter, the Princess
        Mary.”</p>

    <p>Catherine roused herself, her weakness had
        been but momentary, and she regained her
        composure almost as quickly as she had lost it.</p>

    <p>“It is for the Princess Mary that I live,” she
        said quietly; “in my good daughter I have an
        assured comfort.”</p>

    <p>“’Twas the horoscope of the princess that
        this wizard cast, who is now below,” her
        attendant said. “I should like to have your
        majesty see him; he would furnish much entertainment
        for an hour on such an evening as
        this.” The good woman was eager to change
        the drift of Catherine’s thoughts.</p>

    <p>The queen smiled as she turned to Betty.</p>

    <p>“What say you, maiden?” she asked;
        “would this marvellous little man divert my
        poor girls for an hour?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“I cannot tell,” Betty answered soberly, for
        she was touched at the queen’s emotion—Catherine’s
        habitual coldness was repulsive,
        but in such moments of sorrow she was more
        attractive; “’tis certain that he furnished me
        with ten minutes of sharp entertainment this
        noon,” and she told them briefly of the wild
        gallop of the wizard and her own misadventure.</p>

    <p>“We must see this fiery horseman, if Bedingfield
        will let us,” said the queen when she
        had heard the story; “see, my maids, how
        obedient I grow from force of habit! If her
        jailer wills it, the Queen of England would
        see a travelling wizard for an hour of wild
        diversion. Forsooth, ’twill cast in shadow
        the jousts at Greenwich in honor of the Marchioness
        of Pembroke! Go you, Mistress
        Carew, for you are in favor, and pray Sir
        Edmund to send this fortune-teller to us.”</p>

    <p>Thus admonished, Betty went upon the
        errand with alacrity, glad to escape from the
        sadness that the queen’s mood had cast upon
        the scene, and moved, too, by a young girl’s
        curiosity which had been awakened by the
        reports of the wizard. She found Bedingfield
        still entertaining the small stranger, and preferred
        Catherine’s suit with some hesitation
        on account of his presence. Sir Edmund’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
        face clouded a little at the proposition and he
        stood a few moments staring moodily at the
        floor. Betty, standing at a short distance,
        observed the two with interested eyes. The
        wizard had fastened his gaze on his companion’s
        face as soon as Betty told her errand
        and watched him much as a cat watches a
        mouse, but there was no expression on his
        small and wizened countenance to indicate his
        feelings. He was sitting on a low settle,
        his short legs drawn under it and his chin
        resting in his hands; something in his gray
        hair and dull skin, his brown clothing and
        diminutive size, gave him the appearance of
        some hobgoblin of fairy lore. Bedingfield was
        manifestly puzzled; the queen’s request was
        simple and natural enough, and there seemed
        no reasonable excuse for denying it, yet Sir
        Edmund was uneasy. There was something
        about the wizard which indicated a keen wit
        and no ordinary energy of purpose, and Bedingfield
        knew that there were dealings with Rome
        and Spain,—dealings that Cromwell and the
        king desired to break off,—and here was a
        stranger who might be bent on mischief, yet
        there was no reasonable excuse to refuse him
        admittance to the queen’s presence. The fact
        that he had not petitioned for it was in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
        favor and Bedingfield knew well enough that
        the poor women in his charge were sadly in
        need of some small diversion. Catherine had
        done wisely to choose Betty Carew for her messenger;
        the wistful expression on the young
        girl’s fresh face went far toward prevailing
        with Sir Edmund. After a few moments of
        hesitation, he despatched one of his own gentlemen
        with the wizard, to conduct him to the
        queen and remain in attendance during the
        interview, at the same time bidding Betty go
        before to warn the little court that the request
        was granted.</p>

    <p>Mistress Carew sped on her errand with the
        swift feet of youth, and before the wizard and
        his escort had reached the top of the stair, she
        had entered the queen’s room. As she lifted
        the curtain at the door, something in the scene
        within arrested her attention. Catherine sat
        more erect than usual, and her three maids were
        gathered about her talking in low tones; there
        was an animation in their looks so unusual
        that Betty thought in an instant that there was
        some new interest in the air, some scheme
        afoot. At the sight of her, however, the
        habitual expressions came back to their faces,
        and Catherine received her announcement with
        her usual manner.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“I have no royal robes to assume,” she said,
        in a tone of bitterness, “but truly there must
        be some state with which to hold our levee.
        Come, my girls, stand around me, arrange the
        log upon the hearth, move yonder fire-screen;
        the Queen of England will receive the wizard
        Sanders!”</p>

    <p>“Madam, the jest is bitter,” replied Patience,
        sadly; “spare us—who so bemoan your case—the
        sharp edge of your wit, whereby the loss
        of your high estate is in no manner redeemed.
        You are still our gracious sovereign lady, and
        so would be were you an outcast from this
        realm which hath so uncharitably used you.”</p>

    <p>“I thank you, wench,” Catherine replied,
        her face softening at the expression of her
        attendant’s devotion; “you teach the queen to
        bear herself more worthily. Ah, good Patience,
        you know not how deep the wound corrodes my
        lonely heart. Albeit a queen, and the daughter
        of a king, I am yet a woman, and a woman’s
        heart doth crave a little tenderness,—a little
        love,—a little shelter, or else, God wot, it
        starves!”</p>

    <p>All her attendants drew nearer to her chair,
        and tears shone in their eyes; the touch of
        womanly weakness in the cold character of the
        injured princess appealed to them more sharply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
        because of its contrast with her habitual austerity.
        Catherine pressed her handkerchief to her
        own eyes, and there was a painful silence,
        broken only by the sound of footsteps at the
        door and the voice of the usher announcing the
        entrance of the wizard. At this interruption
        the queen was herself in a moment, and
        received the visitor with her usual cold
        dignity.</p>

    <p>The scene was a strange one; the fire was
        burning low on the hearth, but a bright glow
        shone from the bed of fiery embers in which
        the fallen log lay smouldering. The room, a
        large and gloomy one, was hung with dark
        tapestries, which increased the somber effect,
        and it was only imperfectly lighted by the
        narrow windows at the farther end. In her
        great chair by the chimney sat the queen clad
        in black, and her hair entirely concealed by
        her velvet cap. Around her were grouped her
        four ladies, Betty Carew alone blooming with
        youth and beauty in this sad place. Into this
        little company of women came now the small,
        strange figure of the man who called himself
        Zachary Sanders, the most famous wizard in
        the south of England. He still wore his russet
        cloak, fastened by a clasp and chain that had
        been loosened so the mantle hung behind, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
        kept from slipping off his shoulders by the
        chain. His jacket and doublet were of russet-colored
        sarsenet, and he wore no ornament but
        a curiously wrought silver serpent, which was
        secured below his collar and hung on his
        breast. Without his hat he was a far more
        notable person than with it, for he had a large
        and finely developed head, the sphere of the
        brain well arched and full and with no ugly
        slant of the forehead, and not too protuberant
        behind, but with a fine line from the nape of
        the neck to the crown. His owlish eyebrows
        and pointed gray beard and mustache gave a
        slightly sinister cast to his features, but his
        eyes were so remarkable, both for size and
        brilliancy, that all else sank into insignificance
        by contrast. He came forward with an ease
        that indicated a person accustomed to encountering
        people of all ranks in life, one who
        was as little likely to be amazed at magnificence
        as he would be touched by distress. He
        made a profound obeisance to the queen, and
        she held out her hand, prompted, perhaps, by
        the thought that she could not afford to lose a
        friend, however humble. He knelt on one
        knee and kissed it with an apparently sincere
        feeling of homage.</p>

    <p>“I have heard of you many times, sir,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
        Catherine, gravely, “and my women were
        eager to have some entertainment and instruction.
        Doubtless they would look curiously
        into the future, fancying great things in store.
        I pray you gratify their innocent desires, if
        you may; for my part, such prognostications
        are of little comfort. Having encountered so
        great disasters, I do dread to look beyond the
        hour; for me such dreams are done.”</p>

    <p>“Yet it should not be so, your grace,” the
        wizard answered, regarding the queen earnestly;
        “your horoscope hath no such evil
        ending to it.”</p>

    <p>“You flatter me, good Sanders,” she replied
        bitterly; “I am no longer young enough to be
        deceived by such follies. Here is a maid
        whose fortune should smile like her face,” she
        added, pointing to Mistress Betty, who stood
        near her; “your arts should weave a tale of
        love and happiness for youth and beauty.”</p>

    <p>“I cast her horoscope this noon at the Blue
        Boar,” the wizard said, with a queer smile.
        “Venus was in fortunate conjunction with
        Mars when Mistress Carew was born.”</p>

    <p>“Did you learn that by striking my horse,
        Master Sanders?” Betty retorted, with a
        mischievous glance from under her black
        lashes.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>The astrologer looked at her with an immovable
        face.</p>

    <p>“You are mistaken,” he said calmly; “I
        touched not the beast. It sometimes happens
        that these dumb creatures recognize a power
        more than human, and are so thrown into a
        convulsion of terror.”</p>

    <p>“With your aid?” persisted the young girl,
        laughing incredulously, and even the queen
        smiled.</p>

    <p>“My young mistress is inclined to jest,”
        Sanders remarked grimly, “and to make light
        of my art, but this will not be so when she
        talks to her affianced husband.”</p>

    <p>“My affianced husband!” exclaimed Betty,
        with indignation; “you are much in error in
        good sooth, for I am not promised.”</p>

    <p>The wizard looked at her and laughed, his
        brilliant eyes almost fascinating the young
        girl’s startled gaze.</p>

    <p>“You were promised in your cradle, and a
        lovely mate you are like to get, Mistress
        Carew,” he answered quietly, with such a
        tone of certainty that Betty experienced a
        sharp sensation of apprehension.</p>

    <p>“’Tis false!” she exclaimed passionately, her
        agitation so genuine that the queen interposed.</p>

    <p>“Why fret the child, sir wizard?” Catherine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
        said; “what warrant have you for this
        statement?”</p>

    <p>Sanders turned to her with courteous respect,
        although his face showed a certain malicious
        enjoyment.</p>

    <p>“We read these matters in the stars, madam,”
        he said gravely, “and they cannot mislead us.
        Mistress Carew is promised to a tall, dark
        man with a sword-cut across his left eyebrow;
        one day she will find that the astrologer has
        not lied.”</p>

    <p>Seeing Betty’s angry alarm, Catherine turned
        the matter aside; she had the tact to avoid a
        scene which was becoming unpleasant.</p>

    <p>“You claim that all your knowledge is from
        the stars, sir?” she asked indifferently, “and
        there is no human agency in the affair?”</p>

    <p>“None, madam,” the wizard rejoined
        solemnly; “we read the destinies of men and
        women in the heavens, and the future even of
        this realm unrolls itself in that great scroll for
        the marvelling eye of the seer to read.”</p>

    <p>The queen leaned back in her chair and
        shaded her eyes with her hand.</p>

    <p>“The future of this realm!” she said in a
        low voice; “I pray the saints for it! I, who
        have never done England any good, would be
        sorry indeed to do it harm.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“You need have no fear, madam,” the sage
        rejoined, speaking as low as she, so that the
        usher sent by Bedingfield, who was posted at
        the door, could not catch their words.</p>

    <p>Catherine looked up quickly.</p>

    <p>“You speak confidently,” she said; “why
        so?”</p>

    <p>“Your grace does well to ask,” he answered
        gravely. “I have seen a vision, such an one
        as no man sees but once or twice in a lifetime,
        even though he is born to read the stars.”</p>

    <p>“Speak on,” said the queen, as he paused.</p>

    <p>The little circle by the fire had drawn close,
        all eager attention except Mistress Betty, who
        stood apart, angry and secretly alarmed, although
        she fought stoutly against the dread
        which beset her. At the queen’s admonition,
        the wizard drew nearer, and stood facing the
        hearth, the red glow of the embers casting a
        lurid light on his wizened figure and a fiery
        glint in his great eyes. He did not seem to
        see the others, but recited his tale like a man
        in a trance.</p>

    <p>“’Twas night,” he said, “and I was in my
        laboratory studying the heavens. Mars was
        red as blood. Suddenly, before me, there was
        a wide ray of white light which constantly
        expanded, until I saw in it a marvellous flower-garden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
        a vast place, full of bloom and with
        great gates, on which were emblazoned the
        arms of England. Within, there was a tall
        white rose upon a single stem, and it shone
        lustrous. No one was in the garden, and without
        were the pope, the Emperor of the Germans,
        and the Queen of Hungary, while, closer to
        the gate, stood your grace’s champion, Reginald
        Pole. Presently I saw a woman walking
        through the garden dressed in cloth of gold,
        with a crown on her head, and on her robes
        the arms of England and Spain united. She
        came across the garden to the white rose, and
        it bowed down to her; she plucked it, holding
        it up and looking at Pole, and then I knew
        her. After that, she touched the gates with
        the white rose and they flew open, and those
        without came in and kissed her. When she
        kneeled to receive the pope’s blessing, I saw
        her face plainly; it was the Princess Mary.”</p>

    <p>When he ceased speaking, Catherine covered
        her face with her hands; the superstition of
        the age and her blood stirred within a naturally
        strong woman. After a moment, she spoke
        almost in a whisper.</p>

    <p>“And the king?” she said.</p>

    <p>“Madam, you know the northern prophecy,”
        the wizard replied; “the decorate rose shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
        slain in his mother’s womb,—which means
        the death of one who hath offended. And
        she”—the speaker lowered his voice so that it
        was scarcely more than a whisper—“she who
        hath wrought this woe, her horoscope doth
        show a sudden and a shameful death.”</p>

    <p>“I pray it may be so!” exclaimed one of
        the queen’s women; “may a curse light on her—may—”</p>

    <p>“Nay, curse her not,” interrupted Catherine,
        coldly; “the time is not far off when ye shall
        have great reason to pity her, yea, to commiserate
        her estate.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” replied the wizard, “an agony awaits
        her—a blood-red axe is in her destiny.”</p>

    <p>This low-spoken conversation had irritated
        the attendant sent by Bedingfield, and conscious
        that to permit it to continue would be a
        transgression of his orders, he came forward
        now and reminded Sanders that he had exceeded
        the limit of his visit. The queen resented the
        interference, and turned as if to speak in
        anger; but, on second thought, repented her
        determination, only treating the matter with
        her accustomed scorn.</p>

    <p>“Tell your master,” she said to the usher,
        “that the queen was so wonderfully entertained
        that she forgot her usual obedience to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
        orders and craves his pardon. Master Sanders,
        I thank you for your diverting discourse,” she
        added to the astrologer. “I am so poor I may
        not even reward my entertainment; but continue,
        sir, to read in the stars the salvation of
        this realm, and so find your reward.”</p>

    <p>The wizard made his obeisance and turned
        to withdraw; as he did so, a tiny packet fell
        from under his cloak, and Mistress Betty noted
        that Patience set her foot upon it, making no
        effort to restore it to its owner. When he
        reached the door, Sanders turned for the last
        time toward the queen, and making a strange
        sign with his hands, bowed and withdrew.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

            <small>MISTRESS CAREW’S ALLEGIANCE</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was dusk; the shadows were folding
        thickly about the gloomy walls of Kimbolton.
        In the queen’s drawing-room Betty Carew sat
        alone, a solitary taper burning on the table
        beside her, while she mechanically turned the
        leaves of the illuminated missal, her thoughts
        being far away. The queen had been ill for
        some days; she was able to sit up, but kept
        her own chamber. Below, in the apartments
        of Bedingfield, were two gentlemen from the
        privy council, and with them, as Betty knew,
        the Marquis of Exeter. Something had happened;
        what, the young girl scarcely divined.
        The three visitors had arrived almost at daybreak,
        and at noon there had been a stormy
        interview in Catherine’s room, from which
        Mistress Carew was excluded. After it was
        over, the queen was in more distress than
        Betty had ever seen her; she even wept,
        and called passionately for her daughter,—an
        unusual outbreak, followed by a season of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
        exhaustion. She was reported now to be
        asleep, her three favorite attendants watching
        her, while the youngest of all sat like an outcast
        and a spy in the outer room. There had
        been much secret dealing of late, Betty knew,
        and she felt that they were careful to shut her
        out, ever suspicious of her motives. That
        day, she had heard Exeter remonstrate with
        Bedingfield on the mean state of the household
        and on the queen’s poor attendance; and Sir
        Edmund replied that he must even obey his
        orders, and that as for state, he had no money,
        and the council allowed none to support the
        princess dowager.</p>

    <p>“Poor lady!” Exeter said, “there is little
        need of all this watch and ward; if I be not
        mistaken, there cometh soon a guest which
        no bars shall keep out and no privy council
        examine.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, so it looks,” Bedingfield replied, “and
        yet I know not; she hath been ailing long, but
        seems to fight her malady as steadfastly as she
        did the divorce.”</p>

    <p>“A gallant heart,” my lord of Exeter replied,
        “but she will die. Her eye looks it and her
        dull and yellowish hue betrays it. ’Tis no
        place here either to stir the laggard blood
        in her veins; she is a Spaniard, and this sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
        weather suits her as little as our northern
        temperaments. The end of a great sorrow
        draweth nigh.”</p>

    <p>So spoke the marquis, and Betty, hearing
        him, felt a chill at her heart. The gloomy life
        had weighed upon her, and she fell often into
        meditations which were full of dim foreboding.
        The wizard’s tale had stolen into her brain
        and found a lodgment there, and she dreaded
        something, what she knew not. Youth is
        fanciful, and sees either a flood of sunshine on
        the path or a thick cloud. While the shadows
        without lengthened into night, Betty sat alone;
        and then there was a soft footfall behind her,
        and Patience came to summon her to the
        queen. Something in the woman’s face betrayed
        that the call was unusual, and Mistress
        Carew was yet more surprised when she found
        herself alone with Catherine, who sat propped
        up in her chair, a rosary in her hands and her
        black mantilla shading her features even more
        than usual. The lights were so arranged that
        her face was in the gloom, and it was impossible
        to see her expression.</p>

    <p>“My visitors are still below, as I hear, Mistress
        Betty,” she said quietly, “and I would
        ask you to do an errand for me. Here is a
        little packet which, I pray you, give my lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
        of Exeter from the queen. These gentlemen
        will look askance at my own poor maids, but
        you, my child, are in favor with the powers
        that be.”</p>

    <p>Betty stood a moment irresolute, her heart
        beating high. The hour had come for her to
        show herself worthy of her uncle’s confidence.
        She could not deceive herself about the packet;
        it was the same which the wizard had let fall
        a few weeks before. She was silent, her eyes
        downcast.</p>

    <p>“What ails you, mistress?” cried the queen,
        sharply; “have you no tongue to answer me?”</p>

    <p>“Madam,” replied Betty, her tone faltering
        ever so slightly, “I may not disobey my
        instructions.”</p>

    <p>“Your instructions!” repeated Catherine,
        sternly; “from whom—and when?”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty’s cheek was scarlet. How
        could she speak the truth to this injured
        woman, although the truth was not to her own
        discredit? Her embarrassment carried conviction
        to the queen’s mind, and she was
        passionately incensed.</p>

    <p>“So!” she said, in her coldest and most
        sarcastic tone, “the dove was but the serpent in
        disguise. For shame! How could one so
        young, so seeming innocent, become a tool in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
        the hands of villains? Had you no woman’s
        heart that you could spy upon and betray a
        woman—and she your queen? My God! the
        very babes and sucklings are utterly corrupted,
        vile traitors and heretics!”</p>

    <p>“Madam,” Betty cried, with deep resentment,
        “you do me bitter wrong! I am no spy,
        nor would my uncle have sent me to fill so foul
        an office. I cannot—nay, I will not carry
        secret missives against my instructions! That
        would be as deep a treason to this realm as it
        would be to you did I purpose to betray you.”</p>

    <p>“You say ‘I will not’ to your queen?”
        exclaimed Catherine, harshly; “the saints bear
        witness that the time was when so saucy a
        tongue would have been treason. It is well to
        make fine protests, wench, but ’twill be long
        ere you find one so foolish as to credit them.”</p>

    <p>“For that there is no help, madam,” Betty
        answered firmly. “I will even tell you the
        whole truth; my uncle did forbid me to carry
        any secret missives, or to meddle with these
        matters, since he bade me remember that the
        safety of this realm was a greater matter than
        the sorrows of one woman, albeit she is a
        queen.”</p>

    <p>“Is a queen!” cried Catherine, catching at
        the words; “thine uncle is a worthy man—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
        honest man. I am still a queen, it seems,
        despite the universities and Cranmer! Ah,
        well, something remains, albeit I can be
        insulted by a little wench like this one.”</p>

    <p>“I do assure your grace,” Betty said, “that I
        am heartily sorry. I would gladly do any service
        for your pleasure, but I owe also much to
        my uncle; I would not lay his head in danger.”</p>

    <p>The queen looked at her a moment in
        silence; something in the sincerity of the
        young girl’s tone touched her.</p>

    <p>“Is it, then, so dangerous to serve the Queen
        of England?” she asked in a strange voice.</p>

    <p>“Madam, the Act of the Succession,” began
        Betty; but Catherine cut her short.</p>

    <p>“Nay,” she said sharply, “speak not of
        these things; they poison me. Go, wench! I
        have no need of you—such service is of little
        pleasure to me.”</p>

    <p>Angry, yet touched and wounded by the
        queen’s reproaches, Betty moved to the door,
        but there she paused long enough to speak
        once more.</p>

    <p>“I do beseech your grace to believe me,”
        she said gently. “I would not harm a hair of
        your royal head—I do indeed think that you
        are despitefully used, the deepest sympathy for
        your wrongs is in my heart.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“I believe you, Mistress Carew,” the queen
        replied, after a pause, “but those that be not
        with me are altogether against me. I am
        weary; I pray you leave me. Though uncrowned,
        I may claim so much obedience.
        When you are older, my girl, and broken in
        health and spirit, I pray no fairer face may
        steal your husband’s heart. My fate is not so
        uncommon that it should isolate me; rather,
        think I, there be many women in England who
        should weep for me in very sympathy. A
        man’s heart is like a ship which is ever prone
        to slip its moorings; look well, mistress, when
        you have one, that it is stoutly anchored.”</p>

    <p>Deeply disturbed and unhappy, Betty Carew
        left the queen’s room, and going into the gallery
        beyond, walked to and fro. There was
        something so desolate in Catherine’s situation,
        and so merciless were her enemies, that few
        women could have looked upon her with indifference,
        and Betty’s heart was not so cold as
        to resist the appeal. She had often wavered
        in her allegiance to the king’s party since her
        arrival at Kimbolton, and being young, was far
        more likely to be led by her sympathies than
        her reason. Had Catherine possessed in a
        greater degree the powers of attraction, she
        might have won the young girl wholly to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
        wishes; but the unhappy queen was not rich in
        nature’s gifts and her austerity was repellent,
        while her proud reserve in some degree concealed
        the depth of her own suffering.</p>

    <p>Moved though Betty was, she could not bear
        the packet to the marquis without deliberately
        violating her pledges to her uncle; and bred as
        she had been under the new influences of the
        changed times, she had, too, a horror of meddling
        with a matter which she knew involved
        the safety of the realm, threatened, as it was,
        with a multitude of dangers. While she
        walked in the gallery, with a heart full of
        varied emotions, she heard the trampling of
        horses below, and running to the casement,
        saw the three guests riding away, and knew
        that, unless the queen had speedily found
        another messenger, it was too late.</p>

    <p>That night Catherine was very ill, or so her
        maids gave out, and for two days afterwards no
        one saw her but her physician and her three
        chosen attendants. Mistress Betty was not
        summoned, even to perform any small office,
        and it touched her sharply to feel how deeply
        she was distrusted; but after this, there was
        no time for reflections, for events hurried one
        upon another. The queen’s condition could
        not be concealed, and reluctant as her personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
        attendants were to hold intercourse with the
        royal officers of the household, Bedingfield was
        notified of the danger in which she lay.</p>

    <p>On New Year’s Day, at about six o’clock,
        came the queen’s Spanish maid of honor, Lady
        Willoughby, who had been Donna Maria de
        Salines. Bedingfield would have refused her
        admittance, since she had no warrant from the
        king, but she pleaded with such eloquence the
        cold and her fatigue that she finally gained
        her will. Once with Catherine, the Spanish
        woman never left her, but administered to her
        comfort to the end. The day after her arrival
        came also Capucius, the emperor’s ambassador,
        bearing, however, the king’s permission, though
        he was not allowed to see the dying queen save
        in the presence of the royal chamberlain.
        Bedingfield’s vigilance was defeated, however,
        for Catherine and Capucius spoke to each
        other in Spanish, a language which the royal
        officer understood as little as Hebrew.</p>

    <p>Like a gloomy pageant, scene followed scene
        in this sorrowful drama. The weeping maid of
        honor, the stately ambassador, the laments of
        the poor, whom Catherine had ever treated
        with sympathy and kindness,—all these things
        made a sad impression on the young girl, who
        was a reluctant witness of the gloomy closing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
        of a tragic life, nor was she to escape without
        one more trial. It was after Lady Willoughby’s
        arrival, and Catherine being very low,
        every member of the household shared in the
        service of attendance. Although she had been
        tacitly exiled from the queen’s presence, Betty
        was now called upon to go to her apartment, and,
        Catherine’s attention being attracted by her
        entrance, she called her to her bedside. The
        queen’s voice was firm, although her face bore
        the unmistakable signs of approaching death.</p>

    <p>“Come hither, Mistress Carew,” she said;
        and as Betty obeyed her summons, she turned
        to Lady Willoughby, who stood on the other
        side.</p>

    <p>“Maria,” she said, “mark you this maid?
        She is likely to go to court; will she not outshine
        some stars at Windsor?”</p>

    <p>Lady Willoughby glanced in surprise from
        the queen’s face to Betty’s, and doubtless
        thinking her royal mistress wandering in mind,
        replied gently that the maiden was fair enough
        surely to shine in any court.</p>

    <p>“Hark you, my girl,” Catherine said to
        Betty, a rigid sternness in her face, “I die the
        Queen of England, the true and lawful wife of
        the king’s grace. Forget it not.”</p>

    <p>She paused, and there was no response.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
        Betty Carew, standing beside her with tears in
        her eyes, had no words to answer her, and, like
        Lady Willoughby, believed that her mind
        wandered.</p>

    <p>“Kneel down,” said the queen, solemnly;
        and both Betty and Donna Maria mechanically
        obeyed. The room was still, a dim light crept
        in at the windows, the tapers flared behind the
        dark canopy of the bed. The attendants stood
        back in the shadows. Catherine raised herself
        a little on her pillows and lifted her hands,
        clasping them before her; her eyes shone with
        a strange luster in the deadly whiteness of her
        face.</p>

    <p>“His holiness the pope,” she said in a clear
        voice, “hath declared my marriage valid. I
        am the wife of Henry, King of England. I do
        call upon you all to witness; this maid also,
        who is not of us,—I die the queen! And I do
        solemnly charge you, at the peril of your souls,
        to bear in mind that the king has one true and
        legitimate daughter, the Lady Mary, Princess
        Royal of England and heiress to the throne.”</p>

    <p>She remained a moment with her hands
        lifted, her face growing more rigid. There
        was the sound of suppressed sobbing in the
        room. The queen’s arms fell heavily and she
        sank back in a deathlike swoon.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

            <small>THE KING’S MESSENGERS</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">The</span> seventh of January had passed, the
        Queen of England had been carried to her
        last resting-place at Peterborough Abbey, and
        that other Queen of England rejoiced at Greenwich.
        The knot in the affairs of state, which
        had set emperor and king and pope at variance,
        was severed. The unhappy woman, whose
        troubles had shaken a throne, would henceforth
        seek only the crown immortal. She was
        gone, and the winter sunlight shone brightly
        on the walls of Kimbolton, as if to exorcise
        the phantoms of that sorrow which had broken
        a royal heart. Within, there was desolation in
        those rooms where the queen had held her
        little levees, and which now seemed peopled
        with ghosts. The long story of her passionate
        struggle to maintain her own and her daughter’s
        claims seemed written upon the walls. Every
        footstep echoed sadly in the vacant galleries,
        every corner was full of shadows. Doors stood
        open, articles of wearing apparel, bits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
        unfinished embroidery lay on the floor, tapers
        that had burned low and sputtered in the
        sockets left a forlorn remnant of congealed wax
        upon the candlesticks; the great hearths were
        gray with ashes and the dead logs had fallen
        from the fire-dogs. The chill wind swept
        down the chimneys, roared and moaned at the
        casements, shrieking around the castle as if to
        tear its way within and sweep away the last
        vestige of the dead woman’s presence. She
        had died like a queen, calmly and with unfaltering
        courage; even in death her claim to
        royalty remained, and here it was recognized;
        no man at Kimbolton thought of her save as
        the queen.</p>

    <p>Her household was on the point of dissolution.
        The king’s messengers had come down
        from London,—the crown lawyer, Dr. Rich,
        some gentlemen of the Privy Council, Sir
        William Carew and Master Simon Raby,—and
        there followed much stir and excitement.
        Catherine’s effects were being examined, her
        maids separated, her servants discharged.
        The royal officers were busied with many
        matters and were peremptory and exacting;
        messengers ran to and fro, the courtyard was
        full of horses, the hall crowded with attendants.
        There was all the bustle attendant upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
        final breaking up of such an establishment.
        On one side were the pale and sorrowful faces
        of the late queen’s personal followers, who
        sincerely mourned the loss of a good and charitable
        mistress; on the other were the hard,
        shrewd countenances of the king’s commissioners,
        intent only on fulfilling an unpleasant
        duty, and not a little relieved that the cause
        of so much dissension, and such a menace to
        the peace of the realm, was finally removed.
        It was a curious scene, and one to teach a
        lesson in the futility of all earthly ambitions,
        the fleeting pride of all worldly honors.</p>

    <p>In a window recess of the hall stood Mistress
        Carew, cloaked and muffled for a journey, and
        at her side was Master Raby. The two stood
        looking down into the crowded court and talking
        in low tones. She was to ride with her uncle
        to Greenwich upon some errand,—what she
        knew not, but she had much curiosity to learn,
        nursing a hope that she was to have a glimpse
        of the court. However, she kept her own
        counsel, and listened with a serious face to the
        talk of her companion.</p>

    <p>“This matter has been a grief to the king’s
        grace,” he said, speaking too low for any ears
        but those of his fair auditor; “I would not
        have believed that he could be so moved thereat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
        ’Tis said that when he read her last letter,
        he wept and lamented her.”</p>

    <p>“Do men always weep so late?” asked
        Mistress Betty, coldly, her bright eyes turning
        scornfully upon the speaker; “forsooth, sir, I
        would rather be treated with more kindness
        while I lived than so lamented in death.”</p>

    <p>Master Raby was taken by surprise. The
        sudden sharpness of her tone, her expressive
        glance, came after a passive attitude of
        attention.</p>

    <p>“And so would I,” he said heartily; “yet
        surely, mistress, a late repentance is better
        than none.”</p>

    <p>“I would have none of it,” retorted his companion,
        with disdain; “had I been treated like
        this queen, I would never have written so loving
        a letter to the king, no, not I! Poor lady!
        she was too meek, or, perhaps, too good a Christian.
        A little more spirit would have made
        him mend his ways in time. I do think that
        never was a woman who deserved more pity.”</p>

    <p>“There are some who would call your speech
        treasonable, Mistress Carew,” Raby said, but
        his eyes were full of amusement as he looked
        at the flushed, angry face before him; “speak
        not too warmly in this lady’s cause before
        other witnesses, I pray you.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Sir, she was hardly used,” declared Betty,
        stoutly; “I would say so if you were the king’s
        highness.”</p>

    <p>“And if you said it with that tone and look,
        I do wager he would pardon you,” exclaimed
        the other, smiling; “indeed, I believe the
        king has known some hours of regret. At
        least, he has ordered the court into deep
        mourning; but the queen—” Raby shrugged
        his shoulders and laughed.</p>

    <p>“Queen Anne Boleyn? What of her?”
        asked the young girl, a certain scorn in her
        fresh voice.</p>

    <p>“Queen Anne and all her ladies are wearing
        yellow,” Raby said, “and a curious spectacle
        it is. They do say she has remarked that
        she only regretted that the Lady Catherine
        made so good an end.”</p>

    <p>“’Tis a shame,” cried Betty; “she is but a
        harlequin to dress so. This queen was a good
        woman, and so deserves all respect.”</p>

    <p>“It is reported that she plotted with the
        Spaniards against this realm,” remarked her
        companion, watching her face.</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty flushed rose-red; the thought
        of the hidden packet came to her mind. This
        charge she could neither parry nor deny, but
        her pity for the dead woman outlived her horror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
        of treasonable practices. She lifted her head
        haughtily.</p>

    <p>“And so would I, if I had been born a
        Spaniard and so suffered at the hands of the
        English,” she declared; “it was only human.”</p>

    <p>At this Master Raby laughed outright. The
        dead queen’s champion was irresistible in her
        youth and beauty and that fearlessness which
        was her birthright. He drew her out, delighted
        at the frankness and spirit of her
        speech; he was a courtier, sated, too, with the
        follies and the pleasures of that gilded life, a
        much admired gallant, a favorite with the
        ladies of Queen Anne, but here was a fresh
        experience and he found it irresistible. Meanwhile,
        Mistress Betty, whose nature was cast
        in a sharper outline, who saw things with the
        uncompromising eyes of youth, scarcely detected
        his enjoyment of the little dialogue.</p>

    <p>“Truly, it would be dangerous to offend you,
        Mistress Carew,” he said, still laughing softly;
        “but take you no thought of that other aspect
        of the affair? The peril to the state, the sharp
        necessity of loyalty when the kingdom is in
        peril, and the Bishop of Rome would bring us
        all to disaster if he could. Has he not caused
        his bulls to be nailed up on every church door
        in Flanders, and held us up as a legitimate prey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
        for the faithful? Was it not wrong for this
        princess who had been a queen of England to
        desire the desolation of this realm?”</p>

    <p>Betty stood a moment thinking, biting her
        lip and pressing her hands together. After a
        moment she looked up into Master Raby’s
        amused eyes, and her cheeks burned.</p>

    <p>“I believe that I should have done worse,”
        she cried, “if any one had dared to so insult
        me.”</p>

    <p>“Happily, Mistress Carew, no man would
        ever attempt it,” said her companion, softly;
        “your face is too fair to be so soon forgotten.
        This poor lady was older than the king and
        never handsome, nor did his grace ever love
        her.”</p>

    <p>“More shame to him!” said Betty, sharply;
        “she was his wife.”</p>

    <p>Master Raby laughed again. “Ah, Mistress
        Carew,” he said, “you must talk with my lord
        of Canterbury! Must a man love a woman
        because she is his wife?”</p>

    <p>Betty gave him a swift, sidelong glance.
        “Sir,” she said demurely, “I know nothing of
        a man’s heart, but I have heard that it is like
        a mirror and reflects every face that looks in
        it, only that, unlike a mirror, you may never
        break it.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“You are young to be so cruel,” her companion
        cried, delighted, “and verily, mistress,
        you will find many hearts do break before you
        make one blest.”</p>

    <p>“You are a courtier, Master Raby,” she
        replied, “and have a readier wit than mine, but
        you can never make me admire the woman who
        broke this good queen’s heart.”</p>

    <p>“Nay,” he answered softly, “it is you, fair
        Mistress Betty, who will make me do your
        bidding, not I you.”</p>

    <p>At this, she blushed the color of a fresh
        June rose, being as yet unused to fine speeches,
        and Master Raby stood looking at her, thinking
        her fairer than any beauty of the court,
        when Sir William Carew came up and cut the
        conversation short.</p>

    <p>“Come, niece,” he said briefly, “we ride at
        once. And you, Raby, will you bear us company
        or no?”</p>

    <p>“I thank you, yes, Sir William,” he replied
        with alacrity; “all is in readiness; the horses
        at the door, and my man, whom you admired
        so much, in attendance.”</p>

    <p>“The knave will hang,” rejoined Carew,
        grimly. “Come, Betty, there is no time for
        fine speeches or farewells. I must set out for
        Greenwich without delay, and you go with me.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Whither, uncle?” said Betty, quickly;
        “surely not to the court?”</p>

    <p>“And wherefore surely not?” asked Sir
        William, testily.</p>

    <p>“I know not what you will do with me
        there,” his niece said softly.</p>

    <p>“You go to the queen’s grace, my girl,”
        Carew replied grimly, “if she will have you.”</p>

    <p>Master Raby smiled and glanced at Betty.</p>

    <p>“’Tis come, Mistress Carew,” he whispered,
        as he helped her to the saddle. “I pray thee
        tell the king thy mind.”</p>

    <p>“And so I will, if he asks me, Master
        Raby,” declared Betty, with spirit, “and,
        mayhap, it will do him good. A bitter truth
        is ofttimes wholesome medicine.”</p>

            <small>THE MAN WITH A SCAR</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a cold and dreary night in London,
        and through the mist the lights of the inn
        blinked like great yellow eyes. Within the
        public room there was much jovial entertainment.
        It was well filled with guests, some
        drinking, others playing at dice, and a few
        eating belated suppers. It was an establishment
        much patronized by men of fashion, and
        the assembly was of a less motley character
        than that of most public houses. Two or three
        young gentlemen in velvets and satins, with
        ruffs of fine lace and jewel-hilted weapons,
        threw dice at one table, while at another sat a
        stately personage in black velvet, perusing
        some parchments with the assistance of a
        shrewd-faced, deferential companion, the one
        having the appearance of an eminent jurist and
        the other being, no doubt, his clerk. At yet
        another table sat some travellers, whose fur-trimmed
        garments and full wallets suggested
        wealthy merchants. Mine host bustled about
        with a rubicund and smiling countenance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
        attended by several servants and a rosy-faced
        Hebe bearing the wine cups and glasses. The
        innkeeper had the air of one who felt his
        pockets filling and his reputation growing at
        the same moment; a state of bliss seldom
        attained except by those who minister to the
        inner man, the way to a man’s purse, as well as
        to his heart, being through his stomach. There
        was a buzz of conversation, the rattle of dice,
        the click of glasses, but it was yet too early
        for the potations to take effect, and there was
        perfect decorum upon all sides.</p>

    <p>Beyond this room, which was for public
        entertainment, there was a smaller one, opening
        into it by a low door, in one panel of which
        was a little window, a mere aperture, and
        through this the occupant of the private apartment
        might survey the outer room with slight
        risk of being discovered,—a convenient peep-hole,
        where mine host could spy upon his
        guests at pleasure. It was a small place and
        nearly filled by a table and two chairs. On
        opposite sides of this table were seated now
        two men engaged in earnest conversation.
        The tapers burning between them shed their
        light on the faces of both. To the right sat a
        little man clad in a russet cloak, the wizard
        Sanders; on the left, was quite a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
        person. The stranger was tall and well made,
        fully forty years of age, and with a face that,
        while it was handsome in a coarse, bold fashion,
        was also rather sinister in expression, and with
        a sensual mouth and chin. He was very dark,
        his hair, already touched with gray on the
        temples, accentuating the olive tint of his complexion,
        and his eyes being light gray, the
        effect was not altogether pleasing. Yet his
        features were fine and only marred by the scar
        of a sword-cut, which almost obliterated his
        left eyebrow. His dress was of the richest,
        his cloak covered with gold embroidery, and
        the green satin doublet slashed with white
        brocade, while his hands, white and soft as a
        woman’s, were jewelled. His embroidered
        gloves lay on the table beside his rapier, the
        hilt of which was beautiful in workmanship
        and glistened with precious stones. He sat
        with his elbow on the table, leaning his head
        upon his hand and listening to the wizard, who
        was speaking in low tones, though no ear could
        hear him but his companion’s.</p>

    <p>“The trump card is gone,” he said calmly,
        his keen eyes watching the other narrowly,
        “but we have yet the Lady Mary.”</p>

    <p>“Tush!” ejaculated his friend, “what of
        that? ’Tis said the king may have a boy.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The wizard shook his head with a slow
        smile.</p>

    <p>“Never,” he said composedly. “Henry has
        ill luck with his men children. This gay lady
        is falling out of favor, too; another star riseth
        yonder.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, so they say,” retorted the other,
        gloomily; “but the change is like to bring us
        small comfort, if it comes. We shall have no
        merry time until we get the base blood out
        of the council; yonder hell-hound tracks us by
        the scent. I would he were begging again at
        the door of Master Friskyball.”</p>

    <p>“Look you, Sir Barton,” rejoined the wizard,
        “my lord privy seal is more like to pull you by
        the pate than you him;” and Sanders laughed
        with wicked amusement as he eyed his listener.
        “Bear in mind the fate of Ap Ryce, and be not
        too forward. Cromwell is beating the bush
        for traitors, and if he finds you,” again the
        little man laughed unpleasantly, “a short
        shrift and your head would grin on London
        Bridge.”</p>

    <p>“And if it does, why, curse you, so shall
        yours, you evil spirit!” Sir Barton cried with
        a fierce outbreak of temper, the mocking tone
        of Sanders having struck him like a goad.</p>

    <p>“Pshaw!” retorted the wizard, coolly, “why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
        fall out so swiftly? I do not fear you, man, or
        any one. Think you I am so great a fool as to
        play this game and lose? Who was it that
        dealt secretly with the Nun of Kent?”</p>

    <p>He was watching the other with malicious
        enjoyment; noting the start of amazement and
        fear, he leaned back and laughed with a fiendish
        delight that enraged the dark man still more.</p>

    <p>“You are a fiend!” Sir Barton said between
        his set teeth. “I tell you, Sanders,
        if you betray me, I will send you to the devil
        before you can grin that hellish grin of yours
        twice.”</p>

    <p>Undaunted either by the threats or the
        furious aspect of the man, the little wizard
        laughed with apparently intense amusement.</p>

    <p>“Come, come, Sir Barton,” he said mockingly,
        “sit, man; ’tis not in your horoscope
        that you should murder me. I find you useful,”
        he added in a changed tone, “and you, I
        believe, have found me so. Waste no more
        threats upon me; I fear you as little as the
        snake that I keep in my chamber, and whose
        fangs I drew long since, although he is still
        excellent to scare women and children. Save
        your excessive fury until such time as the
        Spaniards and the Irish come to set my Lady
        Mary on the throne, when we shall live right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
        merrily again and this same king shall die as
        did the man-queller Richard.”</p>

    <p>“If we die not first and rot for our part in
        it,” retorted his companion, sullenly, having
        recovered his composure.</p>

    <p>“You are not wont to be so downcast, Sir
        Barton,” the astrologer remarked, “nor need
        be. Cromwell’s new notion of parish registers
        is working for us among the vulgar; they
        believe it but a design to find the means of
        taxing them, and that they shall no longer eat
        white meat or fowls without paying dues to
        the king’s grace. More than half this realm
        is with us; and of the peers, from his grace of
        Norfolk down, I think they love not the new
        order of things, nor do they like the rule of
        the cloth-shearer’s son.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” replied his companion, “we are like
        to have Lord Hussey and Darcy, besides the
        Nevilles and the faction of the White Rose.
        ’Tis certain we can raise the northern counties
        when the time is ripe, and then, the devil take
        me if I be not the first to thrust a sword in
        Cromwell’s belly!” He rose as he spoke and
        took up his weapon, handling it as if he loved
        the thought of the use for which he intended it.</p>

    <p>“The devil is very like to have thee, friend,”
        retorted the wizard, smiling; “but hark! what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
        stir is that without? Some new-comers are in
        the courtyard.”</p>

    <p>Sir Barton walked to the door, and pushing
        back the slide which had closed the window in
        the panel, he looked into the public room.</p>

    <p>“It is a party of travellers,” he said carelessly;
        and then changing his tone, “’tis Sir
        William Carew of Mohun’s Ottery, that young
        coxcomb Raby, and a woman—a handsome one
        at that,” he added with an oath.</p>

    <p>The wizard, who was watching him as a cat
        watches a mouse, smiled maliciously.</p>

    <p>“Is it a young maid?” he asked, “tall and
        fine-shaped as Diana, with red cheeks and
        great brown eyes that sparkle and change at
        every glance, and with hair like the raven’s
        wing?”</p>

    <p>“You have made a fair description,” the tall
        man replied, “but, by heaven, you cannot do
        her justice! She is muffled up, but I saw her
        face as she came in, and she’s a beauty.”</p>

    <p>The wizard laughed again so wickedly that
        Sir Barton turned on him.</p>

    <p>“Thou grinning devil!” he said; “what is
        sticking in thy gullet?”</p>

    <p>“’Tis retribution, sir,” Sanders said coolly;
        “you discarded a penniless betrothed. Penniless
        she is, but marvellous fair.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>An expression of amazement tinged with
        superstitious dread came over his companion’s
        face.</p>

    <p>“How in the fiend’s name do you track men
        out?” he asked.</p>

    <p>The wizard pointed upward. “The stars,
        noble sir,” he answered meekly; “my poor
        art.”</p>

    <p>“Who is this beauty?” Sir Barton demanded
        sharply; “you know well enough.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, I know,” replied Sanders, calmly;
        “no velvet-tempered kitten, either. ’Tis Sir
        William’s niece, the daughter of that rake, Sir
        Thomas.”</p>

    <p>Sir Barton, uttering an exclamation of profane
        surprise, opened the door and walked into
        the public room, leaving the wizard alone in
        the little closet.</p>

    <p>Sir William Carew was talking with the
        host, while in a retired corner, near the entrance,
        stood Mistress Betty, and beside her,
        Master Raby. The young girl’s mantle was
        muffled about her shoulders, but her hood had
        fallen back a little, revealing enough of the
        face beneath to draw the attention of many of
        the guests. But she was so busily engaged in
        talking to her companion that she was unconscious
        of the admiring glances cast in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
        direction. A servant had brought some hot
        drinks for the party and would have set a table
        for them, but this Sir William refused, saying
        that he was pressed for time. Sir Barton
        walked up to him, to be received in no very
        friendly fashion, Carew’s greeting indicating
        plainly that he desired no company upon the
        road. After an ineffectual attempt at conversation,
        the other drew back haughtily, but
        stood watching Mistress Betty, until the persistency
        of his gaze attracted the attention of
        her cavalier, who moved between, giving the
        offender a hard glance that was intended to
        teach him better manners. It was returned in
        kind, the two men looking defiance at each
        other over the heads of those who sat at the
        tables. In a few moments, however, Sir
        William led his party out again to resume
        their journey. As Raby helped Betty into the
        saddle, he saw the tall man standing on the
        threshold of the inn.</p>

    <p>“Your uncle’s friend must needs follow
        still, Mistress Carew,” he remarked; “the
        impudent knave never took his eyes from your
        face; he deserves chastisement.”</p>

    <p>Betty laughed softly. “Nay, sir,” she said
        in an amused tone, “surely the curiosity of a
        stranger is no great offence.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“I should be the happier for laying my sword
        across his shoulders, for all that,” retorted her
        companion.</p>

    <p>The young girl glanced at the dark figure on
        the threshold with new interest; she was not
        without enjoyment of the admiration that she
        was beginning to receive. One of the stable-boys
        came running with a lighted torch to
        help Sir William to adjust his saddle. Master
        Raby bent forward and took Betty’s bridle rein.</p>

    <p>“Let me guide thy beast, Mistress Carew,”
        he said.</p>

    <p>But she heard him not. The light of the
        torch flared full on the figure in the door.
        Even through the mist, which hung between
        like a thin veil, she saw the glittering dress,
        the dark face, and the scar across the left eyebrow.</p>

    <p>A moment afterwards, Carew’s party rode
        out of the yard.</p>

    <p>“Uncle, uncle,” cried Mistress Betty, in a
        strange voice, “who was yonder dark man that
        spoke with you?”</p>

    <p>“’Twas Henge, Sir Barton Henge,” said
        Carew; “but what is that to thee, wench?”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

            <small>MISTRESS BETTY GOES TO COURT</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an hour before noon and the gates of
        Greenwich palace stood open. A crowd of
        attendants and gentlemen ushers were assembled
        in the anterooms, and the royal guards
        lined the halls. The king and queen were
        holding a levee, and, as usual, there was a
        great concourse of people, and the river was
        dotted with barges, wherries and all sorts of
        water-craft.</p>

    <p>Sir William Carew had just landed at the
        water-stairs, opposite the main entrance, and
        was helping his niece to alight from the boat.
        They were accompanied by Simon Raby, and
        all three were dressed in the elaborate fashion
        of the court. Sir William’s suit was of richer
        hue and finer velvet than that which he had
        worn upon the road; his cloak was shorter and
        more gayly lined, while his ruffles were of the
        finest lace. The younger man was even more
        richly attired in maroon velvet, heavily embroidered,
        and slashed with gold-colored satin;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
        and he had a face and figure that would scarcely
        pass unnoticed in any garb. But neither he
        nor Sir William had fully realized the beauty
        of their young companion until they saw her,
        no longer clad in mourning, but wearing a
        rich gown that her uncle had provided for the
        occasion. It was of gray velvet, with a yoke
        of rose-colored satin edged with fur, the inner
        sleeves being of the same tint, as well as the
        facings of the flowing ones, which came to the
        elbow. The gray velvet skirt was looped up
        on one side, showing a farthingale of pink
        satin trimmed with lace. The colors and the
        richness of the costume suited well her glowing
        complexion and dark hair, and she made a
        charming picture. As they passed through
        the crowded anterooms, she attracted universal
        attention, but moved on unconscious of it.
        The painful contrast between the splendor of
        these lofty rooms and the dreary ones at
        Kimbolton struck her generous mind with its
        full force. Here she saw gay courtiers, beautiful
        women, and all the magnificence of a
        court, and she had just come from the presence
        of death. Young though she was, she had too
        strong a character to be moved to forgetfulness
        by the brilliance of the change. Catherine
        had not won her affection, but she had inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
        her with a feeling of profound sympathy.
        There was another shadow also on the mood of
        Mistress Betty; the wizard’s strange statement
        had haunted her secret thoughts ever since
        it was made, and the sight of the scarred
        stranger at the tavern disquieted her. Again
        and again she told herself it was but folly, yet
        she could not put it from her mind; and she
        was strangely depressed as she walked beside
        her uncle through the crowd of courtiers, who
        gave place only to gaze again at the lovely face
        and erect form of the young girl. Behind her
        came Master Raby, secretly admiring her and
        comparing her fresh beauty with the charms of
        the gay dames who smiled at him as he passed.
        At the entrance to the presence-chamber, they
        were halted by the usher; but only for a
        moment, a few words from Carew gaining
        them admittance. The room opened into the
        gallery with great folding-doors, and through
        these the little party passed and found themselves
        in a lofty apartment beyond. To Betty,
        the splendid gayety of the scene was almost
        bewildering, and she paused a moment on the
        threshold, looking about her with perfect unconsciousness
        of the attention that she immediately
        attracted. The appearance of so
        beautiful a young woman standing almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
        alone in the doorway created in a moment a
        little sensation.</p>

    <p>The room was crowded with lords and gentlemen,
        peers and peeresses; the glitter of gold,
        the sheen of satin and brocade, the sparkle of
        jewels, made a scene of varied beauty. Here
        were handsome men and the loveliest of England’s
        women; on one side stood the stately
        figure of a prelate, on the other some foreign
        ambassador; here was a gay court gallant,
        yonder a reverend sage. Not far from the
        door stood the king surrounded by his favored
        nobles. He was, at this time, growing very
        stout, but still retained much of the fine appearance
        of his earlier manhood. His dress of
        velvet and brocade was rich with gold embroidery
        and his breast sparkled with jewels. His
        great size and the natural majesty of his bearing
        made him an imposing figure, but he possessed
        a frank and cordial address which won
        him many friends, even in those days of treason
        and discontent. Beyond him, almost in the
        center of the room, was Queen Anne Boleyn.</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty had but one thought, and
        that was of this queen; and as soon as she had
        made her curtsy to the king, she passed on to
        greet Anne, with feelings of mingled curiosity
        and resentment for the sake of the dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
        Catherine. Anne Boleyn was standing in the
        midst of her ladies, and yellow was the prevailing
        color of their costumes. The queen, a
        young and beautiful woman, appeared as lovely
        as ever even in that hour of unwomanly triumph.
        The perfect oval of her face, the brilliance of
        her eyes and the beauty of her complexion had
        made her the star of Catherine’s court, and
        she was still lovely, although it seemed to
        many that she looked both ill and disturbed.
        She was dressed in yellow brocade with a train
        of cloth of gold trimmed with ermine, a coronet
        of jewels resting on her flowing curls, for
        she wore her hair frequently falling loose over
        her shoulders. She knew that Betty Carew
        had been in attendance at Kimbolton, and received
        her coldly, although with courtesy, as
        if she was at once displeased at the thought
        of her late service, and willing to win her to
        her own cause.</p>

    <p>The presentation was over in a few moments
        and Betty was led out of the royal circle by
        her uncle, who conducted her to the other side
        of the room. He took her to a group by one
        of the windows, and Betty found that he was
        introducing her to some stranger before she
        had yet put the queen from her thoughts.</p>

    <p>“My Lady Crabtree,” he said, “this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
        niece of whom I wrote you. Will you take
        so great a charge, albeit not an uncomely
        one?”</p>

    <p>“Thou art a fool, William,” retorted a sharp
        voice, “to bring the wench hither.”</p>

    <p>Betty Carew looked up in amazement and
        saw an old woman standing by her uncle; a
        woman, but one with so manly an air that the
        young girl was not a little amused. Lady
        Crabtree was tall and broad-shouldered, with a
        large waist and a flat chest, being one of those
        women whose figures are flattened out, with a
        great width from side to side. She had a masculine
        face with a large, hooked nose and keen
        black eyes; the face of a woman who had
        inherited not only her father’s traits of character,
        but his full set of features, even to the
        strong, broad teeth. Her snow-white hair was
        put back under a large and ugly headdress, and
        her garments, though rich, were neither stylish
        nor elegant; and though an old woman, it was
        apparent that she would have been more at ease
        in doublet and hose than in a farthingale. She
        was regarding Betty with a shrewd but not
        unkindly glance, which seemed to comprehend
        not only the girl’s great beauty, but also her
        present frame of mind.</p>

    <p>“What is thy name, child?” this singular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
        person asked; “Carew, I know, forsooth, but
        it must have a handle to it.”</p>

    <p>“My name is Betty Carew,” the young girl
        answered, smiling, “and I trust I may not make
        my uncle sorry for bringing me to Greenwich.”</p>

    <p>“If you do not, Mistress Betty, it will not
        be the fault of your face,” retorted Lady Crabtree,
        calmly. “What say you, Mistress Wyatt,
        is not my cousin Carew a fool to bring such
        wares to such a market?”</p>

    <p>At this, Betty’s face flushed crimson, and
        she raised her head haughtily, but before she
        could speak, a richly gowned gentlewoman, who
        stood beside her new acquaintance, replied.</p>

    <p>“Nay, Lady Crabtree,” she said, smiling,
        “Sir William has shown his usual discretion
        and kindness to bring his niece to see the
        world, and I am sure that so discreet a maid
        will take no harm from the contact.”</p>

    <p>“You are a liar, Wyatt,” the old woman
        retorted, laughing; “that is why I love you.
        To know how to lie gracefully, and at the right
        moment, is one of the most charming accomplishments
        and one of the rarest, albeit lying
        is more frequent than dying. There is the
        substance of a couplet for one of the court
        singers; I was born a poet, but am like to die
        unknown for such. Well, William,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
        added, turning again to Carew, “this wench is
        to be my charge, then?”</p>

    <p>“Ay, if you will have her, madam,” he
        answered; “for a while, at least. They want
        her at court, and I can scarcely make her a
        charge of any one more fit to guard her than
        my Lady Crabtree.”</p>

    <p>“I am a dragon then, William,” the old
        woman said, with her queer smile, which was
        not mirthful; “so be it. I will take care that
        no wolf shall chew up this lamb. She shall
        have good watching, though I think the wench
        is no fool.”</p>

    <p>“Madam,” said Betty, coldly, “I come here
        only at my uncle’s will; I would rather, and it
        pleased him, stay at Mohun’s Ottery.”</p>

    <p>“It would please me well enough, fair
        niece,” Carew answered gravely, “but there
        be others, and I would fain do my duty by you
        and them. Therefore you will stay with my
        good cousin, Lady Crabtree, until I see fit to
        take you home.”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty bit her lip. This settled the
        matter for her, but it wounded her pride to be
        a dependent on her uncle’s bounty and be
        tossed about at his will. Nor did her new
        guardian attract her. However, she could
        only submit to fate, and she was compelled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
        remain standing by Lady Crabtree while Sir
        William mingled with the company, where he
        found many acquaintances.</p>

    <p>“Do not take it to heart, wench,” the old
        woman remarked, her shrewd eyes detecting
        Betty’s sensations; “you will love this place
        too well erelong to leave it. ’Tis no spot for
        any girl to mope in, and you are not of the
        moping kind, I think. Dost know any of the
        great people here to-day?”</p>

    <p>“None but the king and queen,” Betty
        replied, turning her eyes upon the gay scene,
        which was almost bewildering to one who had
        lived the retired life that she had.</p>

    <p>“Poor child! ’tis dull to know so little of
        the great folk here,” said Mrs. Wyatt, who
        still stood by Lady Crabtree; “yonder is my
        lord of Canterbury, and beside him, Master
        Latimer, whom the queen has made Bishop of
        Worcester. Ay, the queen,” she repeated, in reply
        to Betty’s questioning glance; “he was her
        grace’s chaplain, and she so wrought upon the
        king that he is a bishop; and because he spoke
        hard truth to her. And that goodly youth to
        the left there is his grace of Richmond.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, and ’tis a pity that the king can get
        no other son so fair,” said Lady Crabtree,
        sharply; “’tis a punishment.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“How can you tell what may happen in a short
        while?” retorted Mrs. Wyatt, with emphasis.</p>

    <p>“No boy,” said the old woman, calmly; “if
        we have much more ill luck, ’twill be the
        King of Scots.”</p>

    <p>“They will nab thee as a traitor yet, if thy
        tongue wags so free, my lady,” said Mrs.
        Wyatt, with a startled glance about her; but
        her odd companion only laughed grimly.</p>

    <p>“Look there, Mistress Betty,” she added in
        a moment; “’tis our relative, the master of
        horse, Nicholas Carew, and yonder is his grace
        of Exeter and that pretty boy, Courtenay.
        What would you say, Mistress Wyatt, if I
        prophesied that he would be a king of
        England?”</p>

    <p>“Hold your tongue, madam, or surely you
        will lose your ears,” replied Mrs. Wyatt, but
        smiled at her companion’s manner.</p>

    <p>“They can but roast me at the best, as they
        did the poor folks from Holland who held such
        queer notions, which were doubtless no better
        or sounder for the cooking,” returned Lady
        Crabtree, laughing harshly. “Look you,
        Wyatt, they would have treated Latimer as
        they did these Anabaptists, and now he is a
        bishop. Presently they will make me a duchess
        for my sound policy.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Mrs. Wyatt, however, did not heed her; she
        was looking eagerly at a group across the
        room.</p>

    <p>“There is Jane Seymour,” she said quickly,
        “and she is radiant to-day.”</p>

    <p>“And will be more so presently,” remarked
        the old woman, calmly; “my lord of Canterbury
        can make this matter straight, and the
        Bishop of Rome will nail no bull upon the
        doors of Flemish churches.”</p>

    <p>“I pray you speak less idly, madam,” Mrs.
        Wyatt said, offended; “I love the queen’s
        grace, as you know.”</p>

    <p>“And so do I,” exclaimed Lady Crabtree;
        and then aside to Betty, “Mistress Wyatt is a
        fool, my girl; yonder beauty, Jane Seymour, is
        like to be a queen, and I mistake not. Mercy
        on us! can you look for such faithfulness in
        the king’s grace when other men be weather-cocks?”</p>

    <p>As she spoke, there was a movement in the
        group near by; it separated, and the stranger
        of the inn came up to where Betty and her
        strange chaperon were standing. He bowed
        low over Lady Crabtree’s hand, speaking a
        few words to her in an undertone.</p>

    <p>“’Tis my cousin’s niece,” the old woman
        replied in her outspoken way. “Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
        Betty Carew, here is a gentleman who
        craves to be presented to you: Sir Barton
        Henge.”</p>

    <p>Although the tall stranger turned to her
        with a smile upon his handsome dark face,
        Betty felt an instinctive repulsion. As she
        made him a curtsy in response to his profound
        bow, she looked up, and saw behind him Simon
        Raby. In an instant relief and welcome leaped
        into her eyes, and Henge seeing it, turned
        sharply to confront the other man, and both
        looked defiance at each other.</p>

    <p>“Sir, you jostled me,” Henge said
        haughtily.</p>

    <p>“You crowded in my way,” replied Raby,
        with disdain; “give place, I am a friend of
        this lady’s!”</p>

    <p>“Find room as you may,” retorted Henge,
        sharply; “I will not budge an inch.”</p>

    <p>“Until I make you,” said Raby, coldly.
        “You choose a strange place for a brawl, sir,
        but ’tis worthy of you.”</p>

    <p>“Upon my word, this is fine talk in the
        king’s presence!” exclaimed old Lady Crabtree,
        laughing bitterly; “have done, I will
        have none of this! ’Tis too soon to quarrel
        for a child’s pretty face. Master Raby, conduct
        my ward out of this crowded spot; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
        you, Sir Barton, stay with me; I would speak
        with you.”</p>

    <p>Passing Henge with a cold look of contempt,
        Simon Raby took Betty away across the
        room, and then the strange old woman turned
        upon her companion, who stood scowling.</p>

    <p>“Look you, Sir Barton,” she said in her
        hard tone of command; “I know you well and I
        will have no sword-thrusts with yonder boy.”</p>

    <p>“That young rake—” began Henge, fiercely.</p>

    <p>“And what are you, sir?” she exclaimed,
        and laughed so harshly that even he winced a
        little. “Listen to me, Henge; this beauty—this
        young Mistress Carew—is penniless, and
        will have none of my wealth either. You want
        no such lady love as this, and need make no
        wry faces about it. If you behave as becomes
        your birth and station, you may even come and
        go at pleasure in my house, where, I think,
        you would come if you could. But hark ye,
        Barton; if I catch you at any of your devil
        tricks, I’ll have your ears off. Nay, scowl
        not, man; an old woman like me has naught to
        fear from you, and I know too much for you to
        brave me. Ah, I thought I saw you wince.
        Farewell, sir; here comes his grace of Suffolk,
        and ’twould kill me if I could not ask him to
        weep with me for the princess dowager; ’tis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
        evident his grief sets well upon his stomach;”
        and she turned to greet the nobleman with a
        grim smile of enjoyment in the prospect.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Sir Barton Henge stood discomfited,
        staring across the room at Betty and her
        cavalier with a face of fury. A man of violent
        temper, his first impulse was to engage in an
        open brawl, but his better judgment told him
        that an attempt to chastise Raby for his insolence
        would only end in his own arrest in the
        king’s presence. So he was forced to content
        himself with the reflection that when a better
        opportunity presented itself, he would make
        good use of it.</p>

    <p>Across the room Master Raby had forgotten
        him in looking at the fair face of Mistress
        Betty, for ’tis love that makes the world go
        round.</p>

            <small>OLD MADAM AT HOME</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> a great change came into Betty Carew’s
        life. After her introduction to the court at
        Greenwich, Sir William formally placed her
        in the charge of his eccentric relative and went
        back alone to Mohun’s Ottery. The young
        girl, left thus among strangers, endeavored to
        adapt herself to their ways as she had before
        taken up existence at her uncle’s house. Deep
        in her heart were hidden wounded pride and a
        feeling of desolation. She was poor and felt
        herself but a toy in the hands of her wealthier
        relations, and she was alone amidst a throng of
        strangers. She had not a nature which repines;
        the harder elements of resolution and
        reserve grew faster in her heart than impulses
        of love and happiness. She found her new life
        far more full of interest and event than any she
        had ever known. Her guardian was so strange
        and active an old woman that she alone furnished
        no little entertainment to an observer.
        My Lady Wildrick Crabtree, as she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
        called, was the daughter of Lord Wildrick of
        Wildrick Hall at Deptford; her Christian
        name was Zenobia, but she was rarely called
        by it. She married, late in life, Lord Crabtree,
        who promptly died, as the husbands of
        such women always do. He was poor, but
        from her father Lady Crabtree inherited a
        large property, as she was an only child. It
        had been said of her mother that, having borne
        Zenobia, she could do no more in this world or
        the next. Yet Lady Crabtree was a woman of
        strong intellect, keen wit, and an untiring
        energy, and was more sought after than any
        woman of her age in London. Every man’s
        business was her business; she knew all the
        gossip of the court; she knew all the miseries
        of the poor, and she was quick to right a
        wrong and to take up the cause of the oppressed.
        She could be in the saddle all day
        and show no fatigue, although she had passed
        seventy-five; a litter was ever scorned by her,
        and she walked miles through the muddy roads
        to aid the sick or destitute. Time she counted
        as of great value; no hour could be wasted;
        and so as to be out early in the morning, it
        was no uncommon thing for her to have her
        tirewoman arrange her white hair, of which
        she had a quantity, over night. At such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
        seasons, her ladyship slept with her head
        propped up, that the great superstructure might
        not be injured. Her boots were all made
        heavy and clumsy, after the fashion of those
        worn by men, and her feet being large, she had
        the tread of a man. The strength of her wrist
        and fist had been rated high, since she knocked
        down the largest man upon the street in a
        group that laughed at her mannish stride. A
        valiant protector she was for any young woman,
        and as she came to know Mistress Betty, she
        took a fancy to her, so that this strangely
        assorted couple lived very peacefully together.</p>

    <p>In the early part of February, when Queen
        Anne’s illness cast a gloom over the court,
        Lady Crabtree retired for a while to her house
        at Deptford, where she held a little court of
        her own. Wildrick Hall was a great house of
        stone, built by the Normans and prepared for
        defence, its battlements being heavy and its
        windows little more than arrow-headed slits in
        the thick walls. Within, the household was
        like that of Mohun’s Ottery, upon a smaller
        scale, and many people were daily fed under
        the hospitable roof. The old gentlewoman
        ruling with a rod of iron, and knowing well
        every detail of the house, from the kitchen to
        the banquet hall, was something of a terror to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
        her servants and attendants. In her own
        domain she was judge and jury, and no man
        dared gainsay her will; while she drove the
        women like a flock of startled chickens cackling
        as they fled pell-mell before my lady’s
        tongue, a scourge which she was quick to
        supplement with a blow. She was full of great
        oaths as any man, and knew how to hurl them
        at the ears of an offender; yet she had, too, a
        large sympathy for the unfortunate and a keen
        judgment of men. In this household Mistress
        Carew, finding her place beside its mistress,
        was often diverted by her strange ways. Although
        there were always many guests, it often
        happened that these two ate together, while at
        the lower end of the large hall were long tables
        for the others.</p>

    <p>One wintry day, early in February, Lady
        Crabtree and Betty sat at breakfast. It was
        seven in the morning, my lady’s hour for
        breaking her fast, and all the tables were set
        with tapers which flared in the gloom, only a
        little light creeping in through the narrow
        windows. Betty’s fresh face and brilliant
        coloring made a sharp contrast to the hook-nosed,
        strong countenance of the old woman,
        whose white hair, dressed over night, was
        nearly concealed by a great coif of yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
        velvet. She wore a gown of gay brocade, the
        tight body, full sleeves, and huge farthingale
        being in the style first introduced by Queen
        Catherine. At her waist, on one side, hung a
        heavy bunch of keys, and on the other she
        wore a dagger. A fur-lined mantle was thrown
        over her shoulders, and was needed, for the
        sharp wind poured in at many crevices and
        swept through the hall in gusts. She was a
        marvellous figure, her spreading skirts, full
        sleeves, and huge headdress making her seem
        twice her natural size, which was above that of
        woman. She performed her trencher duties
        like a man, and a hungry one. On the table
        was set a chine of beef, and with this, for the
        two women, a quart of ale and a pint of wine
        with a square loaf of bread. It was well known
        that the salting tubs were numerous at Wildrick
        Hall at Michaelmas, and the stores of
        beef and mutton as great as any in the land;
        for my lady was one who lived well and drank
        well, as her father had before her, and ever
        quarrelled with the statute of the third Edward,
        which regulated the diet of both rich and
        poor. No man should be served “with more
        than two courses,” said the law, “and each
        mess of two sorts of victuals at the utmost,
        be it flesh or fish, with the common sorts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
        pottage, without sauce or any other sorts of
        victuals.”</p>

    <p>My Lady Crabtree had received a letter from
        Mrs. Wyatt the previous day, and she read
        from it to Betty as she ate her breakfast, making
        her own comments upon it in her usual
        fashion.</p>

    <p>“The queen recovers slowly from her illness
        and is in sore distress of mind at the loss of
        her boy, so says Mistress Wyatt,” remarked
        the old woman; “like enough, there be other
        causes for her sorrow and rumors be true.”</p>

    <p>“You mean the king’s fancy is caught by
        another?” asked Betty, quietly.</p>

    <p>“Ay, that is the talk,” Lady Crabtree rejoined.
        “Wyatt is too close to the queen to
        speak of it, but I have my information from a
        sure hand. They do say that my Lady Anne
        surprised him making love to the little Seymour.
        The queen came suddenly upon them;
        Jane sat on the king’s knee, looking as demure
        as ever. ’Tis said this brought Anne to her
        present case; and that the king’s grace is furious
        at the loss of a boy.”</p>

    <p>“I wonder if she—the queen—thinks now
        of Queen Catherine,” remarked Betty, thoughtfully;
        “poor lady! she bore enough from this
        same Anne Boleyn.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Yet the statesmen would have us believe
        that the king does all this because he would
        have a boy to leave to rule in this realm,” said
        Lady Crabtree, cutting the beef with a free
        stroke of her knife. “’Tis an excellent excuse
        to marry a young wife to cheat the King of
        Scots. There be others that would rejoice to
        find a King of Scots in a like case, I doubt
        not.”</p>

    <p>“Yet the succession is a serious matter,”
        said Betty, smiling; “I have heard my uncle
        speak of it with deep concern.”</p>

    <p>“Serious enough,” retorted the old woman,
        grimly. “My Lady Salisbury is busy hatching
        an egg of conspiracy, if I mistake not; and
        there is Lord Hussey, who but lately had
        charge of the Lady Mary, a man who knows
        not the color of his own shirt from morn till
        evening. As for Reginald Pole, he fancies
        himself a pope already, and has thrown filth
        enough upon the king and will endeavor to pull
        down his grace, albeit he owes him much.
        ’Tis a lovely muddle, and my lord privy seal is
        as much hated as the devil. As for this queen,
        she has put away from her, by some misfortune,
        the Duke of Norfolk, her uncle, while
        his grace of Suffolk hates her. As for Percy,
        whom she loved, he is like to be of more harm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
        than help to her. ’Tis the devil’s pot and he
        is here to brew it. Ah, what have we here,
        Bronson?” This to a servant who stood near
        her.</p>

    <p>At the moment there was a hubbub at the
        other end of the great apartment. The members
        of the household who were eating at the
        lower tables rose and peered over each other’s
        shoulders, while at the door was heard the
        sound of a dispute. Lady Crabtree stood up
        and struck the table with the handle of her
        knife, her whole manner changing at once to
        that of a ruler of the domain.</p>

    <p>“Silence!” she called, in her loud voice.
        “What fools make such an uproar at the
        door?”</p>

    <p>Instantly her guests and retainers sank
        abashed into their places, and thus a view was
        given of the entrance. There the steward, a
        small, shrewd-visaged man, and the porter
        were struggling to bring in a great-limbed,
        burly fellow who resisted with all his might
        though his hands were tied behind him.</p>

    <p>“Who have you there, Sir Steward?” asked
        his mistress, her eagle eye upon them and her
        clenched fist resting on the table.</p>

    <p>“Madam, ’tis a vagrant caught in the third
        offence,” panted the steward, as he and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
        porter pulled the prisoner forward by main
        force.</p>

    <p>Old Madam, as she was so often called,
        looked searchingly at the prisoner, a stout, ill-favored
        man dressed in ragged clothing and
        hanging his head, as if ashamed of his plight.</p>

    <p>“How can you prove the charge?” Lady
        Crabtree asked sharply.</p>

    <p>“Look at his slit ear, my lady,” said the
        steward; “his second offence of begging in
        this parish was here too, yet he hath the boldness
        to come here again, with his ear bored at
        that.”</p>

    <p>“A very valiant beggar certainly,” she remarked,
        eying the vagrant with pitiless
        contempt. “You are a rogue,” she added,
        addressing the captive; “but what have you
        to say?”</p>

    <p>“I asked but for a herring,” the man replied
        sullenly, looking up, and Betty saw that he was
        cross-eyed, with an evil cast of countenance.</p>

    <p>“And will hang for a herring, fool!” said
        old Madam, harshly; “and it would be right,
        for with that body you should work or die.
        Take him to the justice,” she added to her
        steward, “and tell him I will pay for the
        rope.”</p>

    <p>The two servants began to drag the prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
        back, and he offered no great resistance, seeming
        to accept his fate with sullen indifference;
        but Betty Carew rose from her seat.</p>

    <p>“Surely, madam,” she cried, “you will
        not hang this poor man for asking for a
        herring?”</p>

    <p>Lady Crabtree looked up with grim indifference.</p>

    <p>“He is a valiant beggar, wench,” she said
        coolly, “and you know King Henry’s law?”</p>

    <p>Betty looked at her with passionate scorn in
        her young face.</p>

    <p>“By heaven, madam,” she cried, “you are a
        brute!”</p>

    <p>Now this honest expression of her own feelings
        so pleased the strange old woman that she
        burst into a hearty fit of laughter. Meanwhile
        the steward and the porter had paused in
        amazement, and the prisoner stood between
        them with a look of dogged wretchedness upon
        his face.</p>

    <p>“Go talk to the king’s grace, Mistress
        Betty,” said old Madam, wiping the tears of
        laughter from her eyes; “this realm is full of
        these knaves, and we must hang them or they
        will cut our throats.”</p>

    <p>“Is life so cheap?” cried Betty, looking at
        her with shining eyes; “have we not all to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
        answer for our doings? I pray you, madam,
        spare this fellow for shame of the herring!”</p>

    <p>Lady Crabtree looked thoughtfully at the
        vagrant, and then some strange notion moved
        her again to laughter.</p>

    <p>“You shall have your will, mistress,” she
        said; “here, Bronson, go out and get a dozen—nay,
        twenty stout rods and distribute them.”</p>

    <p>The servant went to execute her order,
        while Betty remained standing, a puzzled expression
        on her face. In a few moments the
        company, to the number of sixteen or seventeen,
        were armed with stout hickory staffs, and
        Lady Crabtree directed that these men should
        form in two lines from the door, leaving a
        small aisle in the middle. This was done,
        while all the members of the household were
        on their feet, women and girls and gray-headed
        men all looking on curiously. The light of
        day, now much brighter, shone in the room,
        and many of the tapers were extinguished.
        When her orders were carried out, Lady Crabtree
        rose and stood by the table, pointing her
        finger at the culprit.</p>

    <p>“Hark ye, villain,” she said harshly, “this
        young lady has interceded for you, and though
        I am breaking law thereby, yet would I pleasure
        her. I give you this chance for your life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
        Yonder is the door; make it, but take your
        fortune with a beating and the magistrate upon
        the other side. You, my servants, belabor
        him well as he runs through the passage; spare
        not the rogue, I charge ye. Now, Sir Steward,
        loose him and let him go.”</p>

    <p>The cords were cut from the man’s arms
        and the two men stepped back to give him
        room. For a moment he stood as if bewildered,
        and then, turning, he started at a run down the
        long hall. As he reached the middle of the
        place, he came in contact with the staffs of
        the men servants, who obeyed the mistress’s
        behests with good will. The beggar dodged
        wildly, but only to receive two blows for one
        that he evaded. They fell on every side, and
        he was driven in a zigzag course by the force
        of the encounter. The dull sound of the blows
        which hit the mark was mingled with shrill
        laughter and shouts of approval, for it was an
        entertainment to the household. Lady Crabtree
        stood up and clapped her hands.</p>

    <p>“Well hit there, Jacob!” she cried; “strike
        again, Andrew, but spare his skull; cheat not
        the hangman of an honest job.”</p>

    <p>There was a wild scuffle at the door, and
        then the vagrant, with a strong blow from his
        fist, sent a serving-man sprawling upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
        back and effected his escape amid a great
        outcry.</p>

    <p>“Well done, marvellously well done!”
        laughed Lady Crabtree; “he will beg here no
        more. Sit down, Betty; you have won, and
        may finish your breakfast.”</p>

    <p>But Betty remained standing, her face pale
        and her dark eyes full of fire.</p>

    <p>“Madam,” she said, “I have no appetite; I
        could not eat the herring that you saved.”</p>

    <p>“What ails you, wench?” the old woman
        asked grimly; “your stomach is too dainty.
        Know you not that the king would hang all
        such?”</p>

    <p>“I care not,” Mistress Carew cried; “that
        scene was one to turn a stouter heart than
        mine. The man was a knave, but I have no
        love of seeing misery made a sport of.”</p>

    <p>“Tush, mistress,” retorted old Madam, coolly,
        “you are a fool, as young women often are. I
        have no pity for a man who would live dishonestly,
        if he could; a dirty, lazy lout, who
        begs and steals. Sit down, my girl, for here
        is a guest who comes to look at your fair face
        and hopes that I may die and leave you rich,
        which I shall not.”</p>

    <p>Betty looked up and saw Sir Barton Henge.
        He had just been ushered into the hall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
        wore a rich riding-suit and carried his plumed
        hat in his hand. He advanced with an air of
        eager pleasure, his bold eyes fixed on Mistress
        Carew.</p>

    <p>“I crave your pardon, Lady Crabtree,” he
        said, with a graceful salutation, “for coming
        so early, but I knew the morning star shone
        ever at Wildrick Hall.”</p>

    <p>“A very pretty compliment to an old woman,
        Sir Barton,” Lady Crabtree said. “You find
        us much upset; my young mistress here flies
        out at me because I will not coddle a valiant
        beggar.”</p>

    <p>Betty closed her lips tightly and drew
        further away; her instinctive dislike for Henge
        increased every time she saw him, though his
        passionate admiration for her was plain enough
        to flatter the vanity of one so young.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew has a tender heart,” said
        Henge, smiling blandly; “I can see that in
        her eyes.”</p>

    <p>At this, old Madam burst out with a harsh
        laugh.</p>

    <p>“Mercy on your imagination, sir,” she said
        in great amusement, “if you can fancy any
        tenderness in the glance that Mistress Betty
        casts at you! You are in no favor in that
        quarter.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Betty blushed furiously, but held her peace.
        She was not entirely displeased at Lady Crabtree’s
        frankness, for Sir Barton had pushed his
        addresses with such violent warmth and haste
        that she dreaded his visits.</p>

    <p>“You are gay this morning, madam,” he
        said sharply, with a glance of ill-disguised
        anger at the old woman; “happily, you are not
        the interpreter of Mistress Carew’s heart or
        eyes.”</p>

    <p>“You fool,” retorted Lady Crabtree, laughing,
        “Betty’s eyes need no interpreter—”</p>

    <p>“Madam,” interrupted the young girl,
        sharply, “I crave your permission to withdraw;”
        and without waiting for a reply, she
        turned and walked from the room, holding her
        head high and with crimson cheeks.</p>

    <p>“There, Sir Barton,” laughed the old
        woman, “see how welcome you are! The
        wench has sense, I tell you, and will none of
        you.”</p>

    <p>“I am not so confident of that as you, my
        Lady Crabtree,” he retorted angrily; “I can
        find a way to bring this haughty young mistress
        to reason.”</p>

    <p>The old woman looked at him sharply.</p>

    <p>“You have an air of mystery,” she said
        coldly, “but look you, Barton Henge, I love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
        this wench, and I swear that you shall not
        disturb her, nay, or trouble her one whit. Sit
        down and eat; you are hungry, doubtless; but
        nourish no dreams of conquest, unless the
        maid is willing, which she may be in time, for
        all girls are fools once, else there would be
        fewer marriages.”</p>

            <small>THE PRECONTRACT</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Mistress Carew</span>, finding herself pursued
        even to Wildrick Hall by the bold addresses
        of Sir Barton Henge, and having a superstitious
        dread of his scarred face, withdrew from
        the company assembled about Lady Crabtree.
        She pleaded a slight indisposition and kept
        her room for a few days, although even there
        she was followed by flowery missives from her
        persistent suitor. They were brought to her
        by one of the women, and after the first two,
        Betty returned them unopened. She would
        have dreaded Henge less had she been more
        independent, but her peculiar position made
        her fearful of his persecutions. She did not
        know how her uncle would view the matter,
        and if Sir Barton’s suit was seconded by Sir
        William’s commands, it might distress her yet
        more deeply. As she sat alone, she had food
        enough for sorrowful meditations; she was an
        orphan and, unhappily as she thought, endowed
        with a beauty which attracted the admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
        that she least desired. Had the suitor been
        Simon Raby, her reflections would have been
        of a totally different nature. But she was not
        yet certain of Raby’s feeling for her; she was
        wise enough to know that the fine speeches of
        a courtier counted for little, and she was too
        proud to permit herself to believe in the tender
        words which Simon had spoken to her. But
        there was no room for doubt of Henge’s bold
        suit, and she shrank with horror from the
        thought of such a lover, although his fine
        appearance and gallant bearing might have
        won the fancy of many a young woman placed
        in similar circumstances; but Mistress Betty
        had a temper and a will that matched with
        decided opinions.</p>

    <p>Henge had been two days at Wildrick, when
        the household was surprised by the arrival of
        Sir William Carew. He had been to London
        on a business matter and came to Deptford to
        see his niece before returning home. It was
        difficult to feign illness while her uncle was
        there, and Betty was forced from her retirement
        at last. She came down to receive a
        kind greeting from Sir William, but to be
        annoyed by the addresses of her suitor. She
        saw, too, that Carew treated Henge with
        courtesy, and the fear beset her that her relatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
        might be glad to be free of a penniless
        girl, at any cost. She was likely to have
        little voice in the affair, not even her preference
        would be consulted; and it might be that
        she would be driven into a marriage that she
        despised, nor would it matter if her heart was
        elsewhere. And indeed there was something
        more than prejudice in her hatred of Henge, a
        handsome man and one usually much favored
        by women. Betty saw, instead, a vision of the
        manly form and fine face of Simon Raby, and
        she found nothing agreeable in her dark-browed
        wooer.</p>

    <p>It was the day after her uncle’s arrival that
        she sat alone in a little turret chamber which
        looked out over the river, and here Sir William
        found her. A glance at his face told her that
        his visit had some unusual import, and she
        was troubled, half divining the truth. Carew
        came in and sat down on a high oaken settle
        beside her and was a moment silent, as if in
        thought.</p>

    <p>“There is some trouble, uncle?” Mistress
        Betty said, a quiver of excitement in her voice,
        and her dark eyes on his face.</p>

    <p>“Yea, wench,” he said, “a trouble I had not
        looked for; albeit I might have known Thomas
        well enough for that.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“You mean my father?” she said in a low
        tone; “then it doth concern me.”</p>

    <p>“It doth concern thee, truly,” retorted
        Carew, gravely; “nor do I see the end on it.
        Did I not love thee, wench, it would not so
        disturb me.”</p>

    <p>“I pray thee, uncle, tell me all,” Betty
        exclaimed, the trouble deepening on her face.</p>

    <p>“There is but little to tell, my girl,” he
        answered, with a glance at her in which admiration
        and pity were mingled. “I find you are
        troth plight to Sir Barton Henge.”</p>

    <p>Betty sprang from her seat, her face aflame.</p>

    <p>“’Tis a lie of his!” she cried, “a miserable
        and cowardly lie!”</p>

    <p>Sir William shook his head. “Nay, fair
        niece,” he said, “it is no lie. I saw the
        papers; duly signed they are, too. ’Twas
        done when thy father had wealth and estate;
        and there it stands, and would have stood, I
        take it, had it not been for thy face.”</p>

    <p>“It does not matter, sir,” Betty cried, “I
        will none of him. From the moment that I
        saw him in the inn, I dreaded him, and there
        is something in his face I cannot endure.”</p>

    <p>“Belike there is, Betty,” Carew returned
        gravely; “yet Henge is handsome, and esteemed
        a brave man, albeit I never liked him, nor he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
        me. He drinks hard and lives better than his
        purse allows; yet I do think that many women
        would believe themselves happy and he chose
        them. He loves thee, wench, madly too, I
        think, as such men do sometimes; and it is
        sure that he will never quit his claim, but cry
        ‘precontract’ if you dream of wedding elsewhere.”</p>

    <p>Sir William’s tone was matter of fact and
        calm, impressing his niece with a painful sense
        of helplessness. To him this seemed doubtless
        no uncommon affair, and a young girl’s
        preference was of small consequence. Mistress
        Betty stood looking at him with horror
        growing in her eyes.</p>

    <p>“Alas!” she said sadly, “that evil wizard
        told me I should wed a man scarred as Henge
        is, on the brow.”</p>

    <p>At this Carew pricked up his ears.</p>

    <p>“What say you, niece?” he asked; “a
        wizard? To what wizard did you go?”</p>

    <p>“To none,” she answered; “but one came
        to Kimbolton,—a little, bow-legged man, with
        a russet cloak.”</p>

    <p>“Ah, Sanders,” said her uncle; “and he
        was at Kimbolton? A sure sign that some
        scheme was hatching. ’Tis well that the poor
        lady died.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Betty told him briefly the story of the packet,
        and he nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>“You did well, my child,” he said; “I knew
        that I could trust you. As for Sanders’s
        prophecy, doubtless he knew something of this
        contract. It is the business of such men to
        pick up all the information that they can. But
        what will you say to Henge? Having heard
        the whole matter from him, I could but lay it
        before you. For my own part, I will not force
        you, my girl; but bear in mind that you are
        likely to have few suitors. You are portionless,
        and this man loves you; of that there is
        no doubt.”</p>

    <p>He was watching the fair face closely as he
        spoke, but he made no sign of any relenting
        toward the penniless orphan. He did
        not divine the struggle in the proud young
        heart. She did not hesitate a moment in
        her answer.</p>

    <p>“I thank you, uncle,” she said with spirit,
        “for sparing me your displeasure, for truly I
        could not obey you if you bade me wed this
        man. I would sooner have his hatred than
        his love, and both I hold as worthy only of my
        contempt.”</p>

    <p>“Remember, wench, that you are like to
        die unwed, a poor dependent in the house of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
        some relative, picking up the crumbs that fall
        from another’s table.”</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she answered proudly, “I would
        rather starve than eat my bread as the wife of
        this man Henge.”</p>

    <p>Sir William smiled. “My girl,” he said,
        “I rejoice to see the spirit of your blood, and
        I cannot blame you; yet this contract exists—made
        by your father—”</p>

    <p>Betty interrupted him with a passionate
        gesture.</p>

    <p>“Uncle, I would know the truth!” she
        cried; “they told me—the old servants whispered
        it in my childish ears, and it ran through
        my veins like poison. They said my father
        wagered my mother at the gaming-table the
        night that I was born—and lost. Is it
        so?”</p>

    <p>Her face was white now, and her great eyes
        were set upon her uncle’s with a look that
        made him wince. A deep red color stole over
        his bronzed cheeks, and he bent his head,
        shamefaced.</p>

    <p>“’Tis true,” he said harshly; “and it was
        to this man Henge, then a roystering young
        gamester, and he held the debt. Thy father
        made this contract for thee in its room.”</p>

    <p>“And he would claim it?” Mistress Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
        spoke in a low voice, but her face was like
        the face of a corpse.</p>

    <p>Sir William bowed his head without a word.</p>

    <p>“By heaven!” she cried, “I would sooner
        be torn in pieces! Let him never dare to
        come to me, or I shall insult him—I cannot
        bear this agony of shame!”</p>

    <p>“Nay, offend him not, fair niece,” Carew
        said gravely; “he is an evil-tempered man
        and may yet work much evil for you. I will
        tell him that your mind is set against this
        union, and that I will in no wise permit you to
        be enforced. But let the man alone; your
        tongue is sharp and will not mend your case,
        and remember that he was in no way one whit
        worse than your father—nay, less culpable
        than he.”</p>

    <p>“Uncle,” she said passionately, “I know
        what my father was—may God forgive him.
        From my babyhood it has been told me—that
        he was my shame. In my childhood it was
        rated in my ears, and in my girlhood it was
        forced upon me by the indifferent treatment of
        those who should have befriended me, the
        canting patronage that made a kindness to me
        a charity. ’Twas not my fault, God knows,
        that he fathered me; had I had the choosing,
        it should have been otherwise, but yet I suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
        for it. I am to be sold as chattel, it would
        seem, because, forsooth, I am my father’s
        child; but I swear that the man who buys me
        shall find that I have enough of my father in
        me to make his purchase a thorn in his flesh
        and a curse to his peace!”</p>

    <p>“That I warrant, wench,” Carew said
        grimly, “and I think that he will scarcely
        break thy will unless he breaks thy neck.
        Surely, I will not try to force thee. Henge
        shall know that thou art so set against the
        marriage that it may not be. And now, my
        girl, make ready to go back to Greenwich, for
        in my pocket is thy appointment as maid of
        honor to the queen’s grace.”</p>

    <p>A change came over Betty’s face, and then
        she answered with more composure.</p>

    <p>“I had no wish to serve Queen Anne,” she
        said; “I cannot put the dead queen from my
        mind, but this one has been ill, too, and in
        trouble. ’Tis well that I should be no longer
        a burden here; I will go right cheerfully, and
        I thank you for it, uncle.”</p>

    <p>Sir William laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

    <p>“My wench,” he said, not unkindly, “think
        not so ill of me that I begrudge my orphan
        niece her bread. I did but try you. I had no
        wish for you to wed this Henge, though there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
        be many worse, for men are not the paragons
        of a young maid’s dreams. But you will meet
        him at Greenwich, and mark me, Betty, bear
        yourself courteously toward him. ’Tis said of
        him that he has the spite and venom of a
        spider, and he is mad with love of that fair
        face of yours; and truly he has the claim of a
        precontract, albeit he shall not have you
        against your will. But these are dangerous
        times, and I have heard that he has the ear of
        my lord privy seal, though I do suspect him of
        being a malcontent and hating Cromwell, while
        he fawns upon him. Make a friend of this
        young queen, and perchance she may do you a
        great service. They say that the king’s highness
        is not well pleased with her, but I take
        this for idle rumor; for I remember when he
        used to ride to Hever Castle to court her, as
        ardent as a boy. ’Tis but a passing cloud and
        her sun will burst forth again to scorch those
        who have endeavored to work mischief against
        her, as was the case of my lord cardinal. I
        esteem it a good fortune to get this appointment
        for you, which I did through Mrs. Wyatt,
        the queen’s particular friend. We will leave Sir
        Barton to Zenobia, who torments him as a cat
        does a mouse; and haste you, for in an hour
        we go by the river to Greenwich.”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

            <small>THE QUEEN AT GREENWICH</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">When</span> Sir William’s barge stopped at the
        water-stairs at Greenwich Palace, Master Raby
        came down to meet Mistress Betty and her
        uncle. It was an accident, yet his pleasure
        at the encounter was so evident that Carew
        smiled; the beauty of that face was doing mischief
        in more than one case, he thought, and
        was amused to note that here his high-tempered
        niece showed only gentle courtesy.</p>

    <p>“Sets the wind in that quarter?” Sir William
        said to himself; “then, verily, Henge is
        like to have a very pretty quarrel on his
        hands, for here is a young sprig who can
        handle a sword as well as he.”</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, unconscious of the thoughts
        running through Carew’s brain, Mistress Betty
        and her escort walked a little in advance, engaged
        in conversation. Half-way to the palace
        gates, some acquaintances stayed Sir William’s
        progress, and the two, coming alone to the
        entrance, stood waiting for him. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
        undisturbed; the king was at Whitehall, and
        but few loungers showed themselves about the
        palace. In spite of his pleasant greeting, there
        was some constraint in Raby’s manner, and
        now that the opportunity presented itself, he
        turned abruptly to his companion, a flush
        mounting to his face as he addressed her.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew,” he said, with some hesitation,
        “’tis said that you are plighted to Sir
        Barton Henge.”</p>

    <p>Betty started, her face flushing more deeply
        than his.</p>

    <p>“Who tells these tales?” she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>“They are but idle tales, then?” he asked
        quickly. “I could scarce credit them, knowing
        that you knew him not that night at the inn.”</p>

    <p>She looked at him with perplexity in her
        eyes. What could she do, she thought, and
        how defend herself against her enemy? Truth
        alone could help her, even while it wounded
        her, and she was brave enough to see it.</p>

    <p>“Master Raby,” she said, with a soft falter
        in her voice that her uncle would not have
        recognized, “there is a contract, made when I
        was a baby; not even my uncle knew of it.
        Upon the strength of that, Sir Barton must
        have set these rumors afloat; there is naught
        else.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Her companion’s face fell at her words.</p>

    <p>“A contract?” he said slowly; “and Sir
        William wishes it fulfilled, doubtless, and
        you, Mistress Carew?”</p>

    <p>“Sir, I will never wed him,” she said
        firmly, holding her head proudly.</p>

    <p>There was a joyful flash in Raby’s eyes
        which brought a softer blush to Betty’s cheek.</p>

    <p>“’Twould be a sacrifice to make angels
        weep!” he said in a low tone, his radiant
        glance making her eyes seek the ground; “the
        man is a knave to claim it against your will.”</p>

    <p>“’Tis prophesied that I will wed a man so
        scarred,” she said, in a troubled voice, for
        superstition had stirred in her heart ever since
        she first saw Sir Barton’s brow.</p>

    <p>Simon Raby laughed as he took her hand,
        which offered but a poor resistance.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew,” he whispered, “may not
        another man be so scarred? Truly, there are
        many who would bear a greater cut for thy
        sake.”</p>

    <p>A roguish smile curved Betty’s lips, but
        she averted her face.</p>

    <p>“But I like not the scar, sir,” she said
        demurely.</p>

    <p>“Then I swear that thou shalt not wed a
        scarred face,” Raby answered; and he kissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
        the embroidered glove that she had left between
        his fingers, having slipped her hand out
        of it.</p>

    <p>“My uncle says a dowerless maid is not
        soon wedded, sir,” she retorted, with a flash of
        pride in her brown eyes; “the scarred and battered
        remnants are for the portionless, I take
        it.”</p>

    <p>This sudden outburst took Master Raby by
        surprise. Unconscious of the wound in the
        young girl’s heart, he could not understand the
        bitterness of her tone. But he had a frank and
        generous nature, and it kindled in quick sympathy
        for the beautiful orphan.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew,” he said gently, “there
        are some who need no richer dower than the
        one which nature gave at birth, and which
        outshines all others.”</p>

    <p>Ashamed of her sudden outbreak, she turned
        away and looked to see her uncle coming
        toward them. Before he reached them, Raby
        spoke again.</p>

    <p>“I know not your uncle’s mind, fair mistress,”
        he said gravely, “but if this man
        Henge in aught offend you, I pray you remember
        that one sword is ever at your service, and
        one arm ever ready to defend your cause.”</p>

    <p>The young girl looked up at the fine, frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
        face and kindling eyes, and her heart throbbed
        in her breast.</p>

    <p>“I thank you,” she faltered, and the flush
        on his face shone in hers like the rising sun;
        “sir, I thank you with all my heart, and I am
        your debtor.”</p>

    <p>“Nay,” he answered softly, “I shall be
        yours, and you let me serve you.”</p>

    <p>And Sir William, coming up, found them
        blushing like two children, and smiled to himself,
        wondering not a little how this tangled
        skein would unravel. But he made no sign,
        only carrying Mistress Betty away to install
        her in her new post before he went on to his
        home in Devon, where there was need of his
        presence at all times.</p>

    <p>The royal household at Greenwich was
        under a cloud. The queen’s illness had disturbed
        the tranquillity of the new year, and
        there were whispers that the king was estranged
        by the loss of his boy, born dead on the 29th
        of January. Anne had made a slow recovery
        and had withdrawn herself from the festivities
        of the court; she chose to be much alone, and
        wandered in secluded corners of Greenwich
        Park, often unattended, save by her little
        dogs. It was an inauspicious time for Mistress
        Betty to receive an appointment in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
        household, but she was kindly welcomed by
        the queen’s other attendants, and took up her
        new duties with a lighter heart since she had
        talked with Simon Raby. The young girl,
        who had been a dependent in her uncle’s
        house, now found herself a person of some consequence.
        Each maid of honor was permitted
        a tirewoman and a little spaniel to attend her,
        and Betty had a liberal breakfast-table, served
        with a chine of beef, a manchet and a chet
        loaf, besides a flagon of beer in which there
        were no hops. But all the maids of honor
        dined at mess, and chickens, pigeons, and
        rabbits were served, as well as beef and manchets
        and much wine, according to the custom
        of the time. Their hours of attendance on the
        queen were ordered by rule, and for the first
        few days Betty was unnoticed by Anne, and
        found opportunity to make acquaintance with
        those about her, and more than once saw Raby,
        who was at Greenwich as an equerry of the
        queen.</p>

    <p>The freedom of her life at Mohun’s Ottery
        and Wildrick made the more confining office
        of maid of honor irksome, and the young girl
        took every opportunity to walk out into the
        park. She loved best the early morning hours,
        when few were stirring outside the palace, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
        she found her best amusement in these solitary
        strolls. It was thus, one morning, that she
        came upon the queen, also alone. Mistress
        Carew was returning from her walk, and entered
        the quadrangle court, where the morning sunlight
        was shining with little power. She was
        startled by the sight of the queen, sitting on a
        stone bench a little way before her. Anne
        Boleyn was alone, and sat watching her little
        dogs, who were playing in front of her, tossing
        a ball between them, snapping and barking in
        the abandonment of canine joy. The queen
        was dressed in red damask, a deep cape of
        black velvet edged with fur hanging over her
        shoulders, and on her head a five-cornered
        black velvet hood trimmed with pearls. So
        absorbed was she in thought that she did not
        at first notice the presence of her maid of
        honor, and Betty had time to note the changes
        made by illness in her face, and she thought,
        too, that she had been weeping. Unwilling to
        disturb her revery, the young girl made an
        effort to pass her unnoticed; but Anne, hearing
        the rustle of her skirts, looked up. For
        a moment there was no recognition in her
        eyes, and then she remembered the beautiful
        face.</p>

    <p>“’Tis Mistress Carew,” she said, in her soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
        voice; “come hither, I would speak with
        thee.”</p>

    <p>Surprised, but pleased by the queen’s gentle
        manner, Betty drew near and stood in an attitude
        of quiet attention. Anne sat looking at
        her sadly, and so long that she became embarrassed,
        and the color mantled richly in her
        cheeks.</p>

    <p>“You are marvellously lovely,” said the
        queen, at last; “yet I, who once so prized my
        own beauty, have begun to think it of little
        value, and that the price we pay for its exaltation
        is too great. Tread carefully, my maid,
        else it will bring you only misery.”</p>

    <p>“I have been taught to place small value on
        it, your grace,” Betty answered soberly, “I
        was fortunate in my schooling.”</p>

    <p>“Alas!” said Anne, “I would it had been
        so with me; but I was bred in France and,
        save for good Master Latimer, there have been
        few to tell the truth to me.”</p>

    <p>She paused, and her eyes rested thoughtfully
        upon the ground, and Betty stood uncertain
        whether to withdraw or remain, and for a
        few moments there was an uneasy silence.
        Then the queen looked up again.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew,” she said abruptly, “you
        were at Kimbolton?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Betty flushed with surprise.</p>

    <p>“Only for a little while, madam,” she said.</p>

    <p>“Were you chosen by—” she hesitated and
        then added clearly, “by the late queen?”</p>

    <p>“No,” replied Betty, quietly, “I know not
        the manner of my selection. One winter night
        Master Raby came down to Mohun’s Ottery
        with letters from my lord privy seal, and in
        the morning my uncle took me to Kimbolton.”</p>

    <p>“Ah, my lord privy seal was then over-zealous
        in my cause, albeit now he cools,”
        said Anne, thoughtfully; “doubtless you were
        sent in the room of one she would have chosen,
        had she had any choice. Alack!” she added in
        a strange voice, “’tis little more than a month
        since I rejoiced at her passing away and believed
        myself at last the Queen of England;
        but now—great heaven! how like a quicksand
        is the heart of man, and swallows up all things
        that touch it! Maiden, I have heard the
        stories of Catherine’s death—were they true?”</p>

    <p>“Ay, madam,” said Betty, firmly; “she died
        like a Christian, and royally—like a queen;
        albeit the first estate is higher than the last.”</p>

    <p>“And I was sorry that she made so good an
        end,” said Anne Boleyn, musingly; “and yet
        she never harmed me, even when I held her
        high place against her. I knew her; she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
        an austere woman and unlovely, yet, as you
        said, a Christian. My girl,” she added, turning
        suddenly to Betty, “which would you love,
        her or me?”</p>

    <p>Mistress Carew stood blushing, tongue-tied,
        for in her heart she had ever condemned this
        fair woman; but now, under the spell of her
        glance and voice, her resolution faltered.
        Anne, accustomed to reading the faces of those
        about her, read at a glance the trouble in the
        young girl’s heart.</p>

    <p>“I see,” she said, rising, and laying her
        hand on Betty’s arm. “Give me your help,
        wench, to the house, for I am not strong in
        heart or body. You loved the virtue of that
        dead queen, and you have seen me rejoice at
        her fall. Yet bethink you, Mistress Carew,
        how mighty was my temptation; and I was
        young and had been bred in that gay court
        beyond the seas. Judge not too sharply, lest
        you be in like case; for you have a beauty as
        great as mine in my first youth. My heart is
        heavy; I would have some about me to love
        Queen Anne Boleyn. I charge you, mistress,
        to think less of the dead and more of the living
        queen, who bears in her breast a sorrow
        and alas, has failed to bring a prince to
        England!”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

            <small>THE STRANGE HOUSE BY THE THAMES</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening and it was strangely quiet at
        Greenwich Palace. The king was again absent,
        and the queen kept her state alone. The gay
        rufflers of the court were gathered in other
        quarters, however, for that day Anne had but
        few of her own maids about her. Grooms and
        lackeys crowded the outer corridors, but the
        lofty apartments of the queen were well nigh
        empty. It was reported that she was indisposed,
        but this was rather an excuse for the
        seclusion she desired. She sat in a great room
        hung with rich-hued tapestries, a fire blazing
        on the hearth and a hundred tapers burning;
        its brilliance, warmth, the delicate perfume in
        the air being a strange contrast to those rooms
        at Kimbolton where a queen had died. Anne
        Boleyn herself was clad in white and silver
        brocade, a cape of Flemish lace upon her
        shoulders, strings of pearls about that slender
        throat, and on her head a coif of crimson velvet
        edged with pearls, a great diamond set in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
        front and shining on her brow like a star. But
        for her pallor and the haggard look about her
        eyes, she was as beautiful as she was in
        her days of triumph as the Marchioness of
        Pembroke. She sat in the center of the room,
        and at her feet, upon a crimson cushion, was
        Mrs. Wyatt. About these two were gathered
        three other attendants, Lady Rochford, the
        queen’s sister-in-law, Mistress Gaynsford, and
        Betty Carew; Betty herself as lovely as the
        queen, dressed in pale blue with a chain of
        dull gold about her neck, given her by Anne.
        There were no others, and the talk was free of
        all restraint, the queen’s easy intercourse with
        her own people and her carelessness of speech
        afterwards feeding the fire when scandal was
        busy with her fair fame.</p>

    <p>Her favorite, Mary Wyatt, was recounting
        her adventures in seeking some one to cast her
        horoscope, and Anne, diverted by the story,
        encouraged her with eager attention. It was
        a charming scene, these five handsome women
        in their gay apparel, in that lofty chamber
        where the flames of so many tapers made a
        luster that expelled all gloom, and only the
        pale face of the queen told the story of the
        secret trouble, the growing estrangement between
        her and the king. She let her jewelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
        hand rest caressingly on Mistress Wyatt’s
        shoulder while she talked.</p>

    <p>“How ended it, Mary?” she asked indulgently;
        “you make a long tale before you
        come to the pith of the matter, yet we know
        your horoscope was cast—and happily, as I
        think it should be, albeit you are a naughty
        rogue.”</p>

    <p>“Madam, I found a wizard truly,” Mrs.
        Wyatt answered, soberly enough; “indeed, a
        king of wizards, though a little man.”</p>

    <p>At these words Betty started uneasily; she
        hated the mention of a wizard since the
        prophecy of the scar.</p>

    <p>“Little in measure, sweetheart, but great in
        power, doubtless,” said the queen.</p>

    <p>“Your grace would find him a marvellous
        strange character,” Mrs. Wyatt answered;
        “when I sat and looked at him and heard him
        tell me the most secret thoughts of mine own
        heart, verily, my blood ran cold.”</p>

    <p>“Were thy secret thoughts so evil, Mary?”
        asked Anne, archly.</p>

    <p>“It mattered not what they were, my queen,”
        Mary Wyatt said; “it was his manner of telling
        them, and his fearful eyes which burnt
        into my brain.”</p>

    <p>“The girl is frightened,” said the queen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
        laughing; “for shame. I thought you a brave
        heart.”</p>

    <p>“Madam, I am no coward, as ye know,” her
        attendant answered with spirit; “but the man
        is gruesome, and he has tales and prophecies
        that are marvellous to hear.”</p>

    <p>“What is he like?” asked Anne, curiously.</p>

    <p>“He is short and bandy-legged, and has a
        countenance like a wolf’s, with great black eyes
        that burn like fire.”</p>

    <p>“’Tis Sanders,” said Betty Carew; “Zachary
        Sanders, the great wizard.”</p>

    <p>The queen turned quickly toward her.</p>

    <p>“Where didst thou see him?” she asked.</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty hesitated, casting a doubtful
        glance at the others.</p>

    <p>“Speak,” said Anne, impatiently; “here all
        are friends.”</p>

    <p>“I saw him at Kimbolton, madam,” Betty
        answered softly, blushing at Mrs. Wyatt’s
        reproachful glance.</p>

    <p>“Ah, a partisan of the princess dowager,”
        exclaimed Lady Rochford, with contempt;
        “you chose poor company, Mistress Wyatt,
        and a poor adviser.”</p>

    <p>“A man does not carry his politics upon his
        face,” said Mary Wyatt, indignantly, “anymore
        than his heart upon his sleeve.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Hush!” said the queen, “it does not
        matter. Mistress Carew, how came he to
        Kimbolton, and wherefore?”</p>

    <p>Betty briefly related the accidental encounter
        at the Blue Boar and the exploit of the piebald
        horse.</p>

    <p>“Saw he the queen—I mean, the princess?”
        Anne asked quickly.</p>

    <p>“Ay, your grace,” Betty replied; “I was
        sent to Sir Edmund to crave his attendance in
        our private rooms.”</p>

    <p>“A ruse!” exclaimed the queen at once;
        “the rogue lashed your horse to gain some
        notice from Bedingfield. How thick are some
        brains not to see such manœuvers! But it only
        interests me more in the man. Where does
        he live, Mary? what manner of house has he?”</p>

    <p>Mrs. Wyatt, abashed at her unfortunate
        blunder in bringing up Queen Catherine’s
        affairs, was more reluctant to answer.</p>

    <p>“’Tis a gloomy place in London,” she said,
        “and would little interest your highness.”</p>

    <p>“But it does interest me, madam,” Anne
        exclaimed, with a touch of imperious temper;
        “I will know all that you do.”</p>

    <p>“Having said so much, Wyatt, there is no
        hurt in saying all,” remarked Lady Rochford,
        scornfully.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Mary Wyatt cast a glance of anger and dislike
        at the woman whom she deeply distrusted,
        believing her untrue to the queen, but she
        obeyed Anne’s behest and told the rest without
        further demur.</p>

    <p>“The house is in London,” she said calmly,
        “and we came to it by the water-gate, over the
        which is set a great image of an owl. The
        building is very old; ’tis said that William
        Rufus built it, but I know not; it is dark and
        tall and narrow, for there have been two stories
        added to the original two, and these upper
        ones are graduated, being like two blocks set
        on the house, the highest being the least, and
        the roof is pointed like the houses that I saw
        at Antwerp. From the outside, it seems as
        full of windows as a sieve is full of holes, and
        none are even, but within ’tis dark as a sepulcher.
        The door we came to, which faces the
        river, is small and very strong, having three
        cross-bars of iron to stay the wood, and on it
        are the signs of the zodiac, and above it the
        head of a serpent. The house, they say, hath
        five doors, albeit you may find but three with
        the naked eye; but verily there should be one
        opening downward for the convenience of
        Satan. When you are admitted there are
        stairs to climb up, up, to the third story, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
        first of the two little ones. Here there are
        three rooms all draped, and here he receives
        you. Above only his favored clients go; that
        upper story is his observatory, from whence he
        says he reads the heavens and casts your horoscope.
        Many gruesome things he has there,
        a treasury of horrors. But truly, madam, the
        man is marvellous and reads the mind as he
        doth an open scroll.”</p>

    <p>“I will see this marvel,” said the queen,
        with sudden animation; “I will go to this
        house—unknown—and have my horoscope
        cast.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, madam, I beseech you not!” cried
        Mrs. Wyatt, her face paling with some apprehension
        which she dared not tell; “if you must
        see him, have him here, as becomes you, but
        not there—not there!”</p>

    <p>“Tush, Mary!” cried the queen, her whim
        taking possession of her, “you are a fool!
        ’Twill be a mask worth playing. Right glad
        should I be to be merry for one hour; we will
        go now—at once!”</p>

    <p>“Madam, madam, ’tis too late!” exclaimed
        Lady Rochford; “the king’s grace will be ill
        pleased.”</p>

    <p>Anne drew herself up with flashing eyes.</p>

    <p>“Who gave you charge of me, my Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
        Rochford?” she said bitterly; “am I the
        queen or you?”</p>

    <p>Her sister-in-law winced and drew back, but
        she bit her lip in passionate anger at the
        rebuke.</p>

    <p>“Have your way, madam,” she said coldly;
        “we are but your servants.”</p>

    <p>The queen turned her back upon her with a
        gesture of disdain.</p>

    <p>“Mary,” she said to Mrs. Wyatt, “go you
        and get me a mask and a sober mantle and
        hood; and you, Mistress Carew, call hither
        some gentlemen we can trust to escort us; we
        shall need but two stout serving men beside.”</p>

    <p>“Madam, who shall I summon?” Betty
        asked, and then added with a slight hesitation,
        “Master Simon Raby?”</p>

    <p>The queen smiled archly, bringing a blush
        to Betty’s cheek.</p>

    <p>“Ay, my girl,” she said; “Master Raby and
        my cousin, Sir Francis Bryan.”</p>

    <p>Despite the anger of Lady Rochford and the
        evident reluctance of Mrs. Wyatt, the little
        party was soon organized, Anne Boleyn directing
        all things with feverish gayety, as if she
        snatched at any prospect of entertainment in
        her hour of melancholy. She was masked and
        muffled until all her splendid dress was hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
        and there seemed no possibility of recognition.
        Then she made each maid of honor assume an
        equal disguise, and escorted by Raby, Bryan
        and two of the palace yeomen, she set out in a
        private barge upon the river. It was yet early
        in the evening, and the moon was shining with
        a light that cast a whiteness on the landscape.
        The voyage up the river was swift and uneventful,
        although the queen pretended to anticipate
        an encounter with the royal barge, as the king
        might be on his way to Greenwich. However,
        they passed but few craft, and came at last to
        the water-gate of the strange house upon the
        Thames. As Mrs. Wyatt had described it,
        there it stood with its two upper stories in
        tiers, and its many windows like bandaged
        eyes, for every shutter was up and not a ray of
        light shone anywhere; the moon shining upon
        the opposite side made the face toward the river
        black as night. The little party found the
        wicket at the water-stairs unfastened and, after
        some curious glances at the imperfectly outlined
        owl above it, the visitors passed on across
        the garden, Mistress Wyatt showing them the
        door, which was hard to find in the niches of
        the wall. Raby struck a resounding summons
        on it with the hilt of his sword, waking echoes
        within the house, but there was no response.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
        The wind from the water was keen and the
        place so forbidding that the queen began to
        shiver under her mantle.</p>

    <p>“’Tis cold,” she murmured; “I should have
        worn my partlet of sable skins and my muffy.
        Knock louder, Master Raby; the fleshy ears
        of wizards are ever deaf, I take it.”</p>

    <p>The summons was repeated with more clamor
        than before, but still no sound within.</p>

    <p>“Mary, thy bandy-legged sage is dead, or
        gone to visit the black man,” said the queen,
        impatiently. “The place smells like a grave;
        ’tis an ill-favored house. Bryan, bring the
        two knaves from the water-gate and force the
        door; I will not have this rogue bar out the
        Queen of England.”</p>

    <p>As she spoke, the door opened suddenly and
        silently, revealing a dimly lighted, seemingly
        endless stairway, but there was no human
        being in sight.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

            <small>A CRY OF TREASON</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">The</span> little party at the wizard’s door stood a
        moment confounded by this mysterious response
        to their summons. They looked anxiously up
        the narrow flight of stairs, expecting to see
        the strange master of the house, but there was
        neither sign nor sound of human occupation.
        The more superstitious of the party drew back
        in alarm.</p>

    <p>“’Tis magic,” said Lady Rochford, with a
        shudder; “let us leave this evil place!”</p>

    <p>Simon Raby laughed. “Have no fear,” he
        said lightly; “’tis but an act of mummery to
        frighten the ignorant. Madam,” he added,
        turning to the queen, “will your grace
        ascend?”</p>

    <p>“Ay, surely,” replied Anne, with forced
        gayety, for the aspect of the place disturbed
        her; “we did not come so far to turn back like
        frightened children. My Lady Rochford, if
        you are afraid, you may even stay without with
        my two grooms.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“I thank you, madam,” her sister-in-law
        retorted tartly; “I appreciate the company to
        which you assign me, but I am brave enough
        to follow where my sovereign leads.”</p>

    <p>“Good lack!” said Anne, laughing bitterly;
        “how hapless should I be to lose so brave an
        attendant! Come, Francis,” she added, turning
        to her cousin, “you and Master Raby lead
        the way and we five women will follow, and
        remember that here I am not a queen, but only
        Mistress Anne.”</p>

    <p>“Madam, your will is law,” replied Bryan;
        but although he had smiled at the fears of the
        women, he loosened his sword in the scabbard
        before he led the way up the narrow stairs,
        followed closely by the queen, who was assisted
        by Master Raby, and behind these three came
        the four maids of honor, while the two yeomen
        remained at the door.</p>

    <p>The tedious ascent of the long staircase was
        made slowly, the queen stopping once or twice
        to complain that she was short of breath, being
        really discouraged from her plan but too wilful
        to surrender her whim. The stairs went
        straight up between two blank walls, having
        no landings or doors opening upon them. The
        steps were imperfectly lighted with tapers set
        in iron brackets at intervals all the way up.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“I marvel if Jacob’s ladder was any longer,”
        said the queen, laughing, as they came at last
        to the top.</p>

    <p>At the head of the stairs a heavy curtain of
        black velvet hung before them, shutting off
        the rooms beyond. Sir Francis Bryan, lifting
        it, held the folds aside that the queen’s party
        might enter, and thus revealed a brightly
        lighted room decorated with dark tapestries
        and carpeted with ray-cloth. It was richly
        furnished, and on the table in the center stood
        a great crystal ball. From this room a short
        flight of stairs went up to the upper story, a
        narrow pointed door at the top cutting off the
        view.</p>

    <p>“We must conjure the wizard, it seems,”
        Simon Raby said, as they looked about them
        at the empty room; and taking a few steps up
        the narrow stair, he struck the little door with
        his fist, after trying in vain to open it.</p>

    <p>It was instantly unfastened, and the wizard
        himself stood on the threshold. Taken by
        surprise, Raby recoiled a step at the startling
        vision. The little man was arrayed in blood
        red from head to foot, his velvet doublet
        heavily embroidered in black, and on his
        breast, sparkling like an evil eye, was a splendid
        opal. He viewed his uninvited guests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
        calmly, his keen glance instantly singling out
        the queen, though she had drawn back behind
        the others. Sanders smiled, coming down the
        steps to meet them.</p>

    <p>“Sir Francis Bryan and Master Raby, you
        are welcome,” he said quietly; “these ladies,
        I see, would not be called by their names, but,
        even unknown, they are also welcome.”</p>

    <p>“We have come here for entertainment and
        instruction, Sir Wizard,” Raby said, seeing
        the hesitation of his companions; “’tis for
        your art to furnish it.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” replied the wizard calmly, his brilliant
        black eyes still fixed upon Anne Boleyn,
        “I saw you when you came down to the water-stairs
        at Greenwich.”</p>

    <p>The queen started and drew her mantle
        closer, while both Lady Rochford and Mistress
        Gaynsford recoiled in superstitious dread.
        Anxious as they all were to conceal Anne’s
        identity, this remark threw them into confusion.
        It was Betty who came boldly to the rescue.</p>

    <p>“Good Master Wizard,” she said, “I pray
        you tell us our fortunes.”</p>

    <p>“Yours I have already told, Mistress
        Carew,” he replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>At this Betty, too, drew back in amazement,
        but Simon Raby reassured her.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“He knew thy voice,” he whispered; “’tis
        but child’s play, have no fear.”</p>

    <p>Alarmed at the wizard’s knowledge, Lady
        Rochford had laid her hand on the queen’s
        arm, trying to draw her away, but Anne shook
        her off with impatience; possessing a naturally
        intrepid and wilful nature, she had no mind
        to be so easily balked in her purpose. She
        walked over to the table, and pointed her
        finger at some glass instruments and a scepter
        lying there.</p>

    <p>“What are these, sir?” she said curiously,
        her natural taste for adventure overcoming her
        hesitation.</p>

    <p>“They are used to conjure the four kings,
        madam,” replied the wizard, courteously; “I
        will gladly show you more curious things.”</p>

    <p>The room was hung with every gruesome
        evidence of his trade, and as he spoke, he
        opened a curiously wrought box of silver to
        show Anne a serpent skin, but her mind was
        on other matters.</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she said abruptly, “are you the wizard
        who consorted so freely with my lord privy seal
        when he was in the house of the cardinal?”</p>

    <p>Sanders was too keen to be caught in the
        snare that she had set for him.</p>

    <p>“Nay, madam,” he replied coolly, “great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
        men have come to me, but not my lord privy
        seal. Yonder is the cardinal’s great book,”
        he added, pointing to a tome upon a cabinet,
        “and this is a ring he wore. I foretold the
        day that he would sit upon a mule, with his
        legs bound under its belly, for his machinations
        against the queen’s grace; but he heeded
        me not, and lo, the end was accomplished even
        as I said. Whose horoscope shall I first cast,
        fair ladies?” he added, bowing to the group,
        for the others had gathered eagerly about the
        queen.</p>

    <p>“Mine,” answered Anne, laughing; “’tis
        I who would discern the future, sir; one, at
        least, of these good dames is too affrighted to
        ask her fortune,” she added, with a haughty
        glance at Lady Rochford.</p>

    <p>“Madam, I pray you, think,” protested Mary
        Wyatt, plucking at her mantle; but the queen
        withdrew it with an imperious gesture.</p>

    <p>“I am happy to serve you,” said the wizard,
        blandly; and he turned, and ascending the
        little stairway, opened the door above. “Madam
        will ascend,” he said, “while I read the
        stars.”</p>

    <p>Without a moment’s hesitation Anne went
        up the stairs, and her maids would have followed
        her, but Sanders barred the way.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“But one here,” he said with his odd smile;
        “more would destroy the spell.”</p>

    <p>“I will go with her,” cried Mrs. Wyatt, too
        alarmed and suspicious to consider her words.</p>

    <p>“That you will not,” said the queen,
        haughtily; “you shall not spoil my entertainment.
        Remain there, good friends,” she
        added, recollecting her disguise; “we must
        propitiate the sage. Lead on, Sir Wizard; I
        will follow.”</p>

    <p>“Be assured, madam, that I feel the honor
        of the visit,” he replied complaisantly, holding
        the door open for her to enter and then
        shutting it deliberately in the faces of her discomfited
        escorts.</p>

    <p>“This is your fault, Mistress Wyatt,” cried
        Lady Rochford, angrily; “and if harm comes
        to her, you will rue it!”</p>

    <p>“Have patience, madam,” said Raby, smiling;
        “what harm could come to her grace
        when we are here? and why should the little
        man design evil against her?”</p>

    <p>“There be plenty who do design it,” she
        replied coldly, “and would gladly compass it.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, those who are jealous of her beauty
        and her high estate,” said Mary Wyatt, with a
        hard glance at Lady Rochford, who affected
        not to notice it.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“’Twas no place to bring her in her nervous
        state,” remarked Mistress Gaynsford; “’tis
        enough to set a strong man’s heart beating.
        How could you dream of it, Mistress Wyatt?”</p>

    <p>“Alas!” said Mary, passionately, “’tis hard
        that I who greatly love the queen’s grace
        should be held charged with this expedition.
        How could I know that she would plan it? It
        was as unlooked for by me as by any of you,
        and from my heart I do regret my careless
        tongue which tripped out the idle story.”</p>

    <p>“You are not to blame,” said Betty, with
        generous warmth; “’tis a shame to charge it
        on you. The queen was bent upon some
        change, some diversion. I know this man
        Sanders, and truly I do not fear that he will
        offend her grace, for I believe he knows her.”</p>

    <p>“He hath the eye of a ferret,” remarked Sir
        Francis, “and with you, Mistress Carew, I
        think he will be careful; he knows that it
        would cost little to split his gullet if he
        designed evil.”</p>

    <p>They stood grouped about the steps, too
        anxious to retire from them, yet each trying to
        put a good face on the matter. Having been
        recognized, Betty had removed her mask and
        stood farthest from the stairs. There was an
        uneasy pause as they waited, and in it they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
        heard a step at the outer entrance; before they
        could decide how to receive a new-comer, the
        black curtain was lifted, and Sir Barton Henge
        entered the room.</p>

    <p>“How did he pass the guard below?” whispered
        Bryan to Raby, and both looked askance
        at the intruder, Raby’s face flushing with anger.</p>

    <p>Recognizing at once that this was a party
        from the palace, Henge made a graceful obeisance
        to the women, and was greeted both by
        Lady Rochford and Mistress Gaynsford with
        some show of cordiality. Divining, doubtless,
        who was within the wizard’s secret chamber,
        he took his place amongst them, but singled
        out Betty Carew as the object of his attention.
        Approaching the young girl, he began to
        whisper to her in spite of her indignant gesture
        of disdain. Her instinctive horror of him
        gaining control of her already agitated mind,
        she shrank farther into the corner, casting an
        appealing glance at Simon Raby, who instantly
        responded. He pushed roughly past Sir Barton
        and began to talk to Betty, turning his back
        squarely in the face of her less favored wooer.
        Henge paused a moment astounded, his face
        crimson with wrath, and then he plucked Raby
        by the sleeve. Simon turned upon him with
        an air that was in itself an insult.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Sir,” he said, “was it you, or the devil, that
        touched my sleeve?”</p>

    <p>“It had better have been the devil for your
        sake, Master Raby,” cried Henge, fiercely. “I
        was speaking to Mistress Carew; mayhap you
        are blind and deaf and knew it not.”</p>

    <p>“And I am speaking to her now,” said
        Raby, with a mocking laugh; “therefore, sir,
        go to the devil!”</p>

    <p>Henge laid his hand upon his sword.</p>

    <p>“You will answer for this insult,” he said.
        “I would have you know that Mistress Carew
        is my affianced wife.”</p>

    <p>At this, Betty came forward, her face white
        but her eyes on fire.</p>

    <p>“I call you all to witness the baseness of
        this man,” she said. “When I was yet unborn
        a dishonorable and wicked contract was made
        that he now claims against me. I utterly
        repudiate it, and my uncle, Sir William Carew,
        of Mohun’s Ottery, doth uphold me. I swear,
        and Heaven is my witness, that I would rather
        mate with the veriest beggar at Saint Paul’s
        Cross than wed with this man!”</p>

    <p>“And none but a coward and a villain would
        pursue so base a claim!” said Raby; and drawing
        off his embroidered glove, he struck it
        full upon Sir Barton’s face.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>In an instant Henge’s sword flew from the
        scabbard; but Sir Francis Bryan, springing on
        him as suddenly, snatched it away and snapped
        it asunder.</p>

    <p>“Hell and damnation!” cried Sir Barton, “I
        will have satisfaction.”</p>

    <p>“Not here or now,” exclaimed Bryan, in a
        tone of authority.</p>

    <p>But even as he spoke, they were startled by
        a shriek so shrill, so agonized, that their hearts
        stood still.</p>

    <p>“’Tis the queen’s voice,” screamed Mary,
        forgetful of everything but her beloved mistress.</p>

    <p>“Help!—treason, treason!” shrieked the
        queen, in a tone of anguish.</p>

    <p>They dashed up the stairs, jostling each
        other in their eagerness; but Mistress Wyatt
        outstripped them all, and was the first to enter
        the mysterious chamber. Here a strange sight
        met their eyes. It was a large square room,
        the roof of glass and the walls hung with
        crimson. There was no furniture in it but a
        great mirror that was opposite the door. In
        the center of the place stood Queen Anne; she
        had dropped her mantle and mask, and was
        revealed in her splendid dress of white and
        silver; her long hair had escaped its bonds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
        and hung wildly about her deathlike face.
        She looked more like a corpse than one alive,
        save for her eyes, which were dilated with the
        terror of a mad woman. Before her, calm and
        unruffled, stood the strange figure of the wizard,
        looking at her in mild surprise.</p>

    <p>“Treason!” she cried again, as her attendants
        burst into the room; “he is a traitor!
        Seize him, gentlemen, bind him, in the king’s
        name!”</p>

    <p>Raby already had his hand on the wizard’s
        collar and had drawn his sword, but Sanders
        was calm.</p>

    <p>“Her grace is overwrought,” he said coolly.
        “She asked to look into the future; I but
        obeyed her behest.”</p>

    <p>“God’s death!” shrieked the queen, with a
        recurrence of her anguish, “he would have
        slain me, gentlemen!”</p>

    <p>“Madam, I do beseech you, do me justice,”
        protested the wizard. “I laid no finger on
        you, nor intended harm to a hair of your royal
        head. Your grace should believe that I can
        but reveal, and not alter destiny.”</p>

    <p>The queen stood a moment staring at him
        wildly, and then, despite Mistress Wyatt’s
        supporting arm, she fell forward on her knees,
        pressing her hands over her face.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Alas!” she said, “the sight will kill
        me.”</p>

    <p>“Call the Captain of the Guard,” cried Lady
        Rochford; “the villain hath bewitched the
        queen; she faints, she dies!”</p>

    <p>Both Mary Wyatt and Betty were supporting
        Anne’s sinking form.</p>

    <p>“Madam, I pray you remember that you are
        the Queen of England,” whispered her favorite,
        looking in agony at the white face of her
        mistress.</p>

    <p>“The traitor has poisoned her!” exclaimed
        Sir Francis; “he shall hang at Tyburn!”</p>

    <p>“I swear I have not harmed her,” retorted
        Sanders, casting an anxious glance at the
        stricken woman.</p>

    <p>Aroused by Mary Wyatt’s passionate entreaties,
        Anne opened her eyes, and seeing the
        wizard held by Raby and the furious faces of
        her attendants, she rallied her sinking powers.</p>

    <p>“Loose him,” she said faintly. “I was mad
        at a fearful vision; I would not have this
        matter bruited abroad; men shall not jeer at
        Anne Boleyn.”</p>

    <p>Making a great effort, she rose to her feet,
        and stood, supported by her maids.</p>

    <p>“Sir Wizard,” she said coldly, “has it
        availed to conjure hell to fright a feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
        woman? I forgive you, but ’tis my mercy
        shelters you from the wrath of my lord the
        king.”</p>

    <p>“He shall to jail, madam!” exclaimed
        Raby.</p>

    <p>“Nay, I charge you, loose him and depart
        with me,” she said, with sudden majesty of
        demeanor; “it was my folly to come here.
        Lend me your aid, Cousin Francis; my limbs
        tremble beneath me, but my heart is stout.”</p>

    <p>She took but two steps, however, before she
        tottered, so that Bryan almost carried her from
        the room, followed by her maids like a flock of
        startled pigeons. As they departed, Henge
        stepped in front of Raby.</p>

    <p>“At what hour and place, sir?” he asked
        fiercely.</p>

    <p>Raby laughed scornfully. “To-morrow at
        sunrise, at the tryst beyond the palace park,”
        he answered lightly, and ran down the steps to
        overtake the royal party.</p>

    <p>When he reached the water-gate, the almost
        unconscious queen had been already laid in
        the stern of the barge, her head resting in the
        lap of Mary Wyatt. And the slow journey
        back began in silence, the attendants all being
        too alarmed for conversation. The moonlight
        still shone upon the waters and fell full on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
        deathlike face of Anne Boleyn, but there was
        no sound save the soft dip of the oars in the
        river.</p>

    <p>A few hours later, her three maids of honor,
        Lady Rochford, Mistress Gaynsford, and Betty,
        sat around the fire in the anteroom of the
        queen’s chamber, anxiously awaiting tidings of
        her condition. Within, an old and skilled
        nurse and Mrs. Wyatt labored to still Anne’s
        hysterics. For she had wept and laughed at
        intervals ever since she regained consciousness.
        They feared to call the court physician, lest
        the escapade should reach the ears of the king,
        and it was long before the royal patient sank
        into repose. Her cries and weird laughter
        had been hushed for half an hour, when the
        door opened silently, and Mary Wyatt came
        out with a look of horror on her face. So
        strange was her expression that it hushed the
        anxious inquiries upon the lips of the others.
        She came to the fire, and falling on her knees,
        gazed into it while she told her story in a
        strange voice, and the superstition of the age
        held her listeners in a spell of terror.</p>

    <p>“She has told me all,” she said; “that evil
        man—that prince of devils—cast her horoscope,
        and told her that her end would be as
        much in shame and misery as her present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
        state was lofty. This, pretending that he
        knew not the queen, the lying jackal! Then
        he caused her to look into that mirror—you
        saw it opposite the door—he told her that it
        was enchanted and would show her her life.
        He chanted an incantation while the poor lady
        looked and saw, she says, every event of her
        life; and some, she swears, were known to
        none. She saw her childhood at Hever; her
        journey to France with Queen Mary; her
        sojourn there at court, with Mary and with
        Queen Claude. She saw her life in Catherine’s
        court, the love of the gallant Percy,
        Wolsey’s interference; the visits of the king’s
        grace to Hever—she saith it was the king’s
        very face and walk before he had the swelling
        in his legs. Then she beheld the glorious
        pageant of her coronation; saw herself, young
        and lovely, kneeling to Cranmer for Saint
        Edward’s crown. After this a black veil hung
        over the mirror; the wizard knelt and mumbled,
        making passes, when of a sudden the veil
        lifted, and she saw—oh, heaven! why took I
        the queen to such a devil?” For a moment
        Mary Wyatt was choked by sobs, and then
        she whispered the rest, so low that the others
        knelt about her to hear, all their faces stricken
        with awe of the supernatural.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“She saw,” continued the sorrowful woman,—“she
        saw the Tower green, and by the block
        were my lord privy seal, the Duke of Norfolk,
        his grace of Richmond, the king’s son. From
        the Tower came Sir William Kingston leading—the
        queen herself. ’Twas her face, her
        form, her gait, her image, clad in black with a
        white cape upon her shoulders, and behind her
        came I and three others weeping. She saw
        herself speak, kneel down, and as the axe fell,
        she shrieked in mortal agony; and in a moment
        the mirror was blank, and no one with her but
        the conjurer.”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

            <small>MY LADY CRABTREE TO THE RESCUE</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the gallery adjoining the apartments of
        the queen, Simon Raby waited for tidings of
        her condition, and also for a glimpse of Mistress
        Betty. Francis Bryan had been called
        away to attend upon the king. Henry had
        returned to Greenwich, but made no inquiry
        for his consort, for of late they had met only
        in public.</p>

    <p>Raby walked alone in the lofty gallery, pacing
        to and fro, with his arms folded on his
        breast and his head bent in thought. He
        came of a brave race, and showed it in his gallant
        bearing and the fine expression of his face.
        Trained from boyhood for a soldier, as every
        English boy was in those days, he had seen
        service both in France and Ireland, and was
        esteemed a courageous and keen-witted officer,
        if somewhat reckless. Reared in a worldly
        school, he had led a gay and careless life; but
        there were too fine elements of manhood in
        him to be choked by the evil that in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
        natures, under such influences, shoots up more
        rapidly than the good. None of his family
        were living except his father, and death was
        soon to sever that last tie. Among all the
        beauties of the court who had won his fancy
        and even touched his heart, none had ever
        seemed so charming as the penniless orphan
        whom fate had made an attendant upon Queen
        Anne. His admiration kindled by the beauty
        of Betty’s face had swiftly grown into the proportions
        of a far deeper passion than he had
        ever known, and his generous nature, too, was
        touched by the peculiar hardships of her situation.
        For forgetting her lack of dower he
        deserved no great credit, since a man like
        Barton Henge could also be completely dazzled
        by the young girl’s personal loveliness.</p>

    <p>As Raby walked there in the gallery, he
        gave no thought to his appointment with
        Henge; a duel was a matter of too common
        occurrence in his adventurous life to be of any
        particular moment. He was an expert swordsman,
        and his contempt for his adversary’s
        character was so great that he underrated his
        skill and regarded him as no very dangerous
        foe.</p>

    <p>After the queen’s return, her shrieks were
        audible even in the place where Raby walked;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
        but they were hushed at last, and in the
        stillness he heard the great clock of the
        palace striking twelve. He went to a casement,
        and throwing it open, looked out upon
        the night. The moon was setting and a few
        soft clouds drifted above it; below, the park
        was full of black shadows, and in the distance
        the hounds of the royal pack bayed in a melancholy
        monotone. The strange adventures of
        the evening might well have stirred hardier
        nerves, and Raby shared the superstitions of
        the times. The weird black and white outlines
        of the scene oppressed him; it seemed to
        him that a calamity hung over the palace, and
        the queen’s wild cries still rang in his ears.
        He closed the casement sharply and turned just
        as the door opened, and Mistress Carew came
        in alone. A glance at her pale face told him
        that something unusually painful had occurred.</p>

    <p>“How fares the queen?” he asked eagerly.</p>

    <p>“She sleeps at last,” Betty replied; “but
        she has been in a grievous state, crying and
        laughing like a mad woman, and would take no
        comfort. She told her fearful vision to Mistress
        Wyatt, and ’tis no wonder that she is so
        distressed;” and with an awed face and agitated
        voice she went on to tell Raby of the mirror
        and its dark revelations.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“I remember,” she said, in conclusion, “that
        he made this prophecy to Queen Catherine at
        Kimbolton, or something very like it; and
        when her maids would have upbraided this
        queen, she said that they would soon have
        cause to pity her and lament her case.”</p>

    <p>“Some estrangement there is between the
        king’s grace and Queen Anne,” Raby answered
        in a low tone; “but I take it for a lovers’
        quarrel, and no more. As for this vision, that
        wizard should be jailed for it. What need
        had he to so torment the unhappy lady?
        Doubtless he is of the party favoring the Lady
        Mary and would right gladly drive the queen
        to madness. Conspiracy is everywhere, and
        the death of Catherine has but discouraged it
        for a moment; the papists are openly discontent,
        and there is a great faction among the
        nobility, who hate my lord privy seal. We
        may be sure that this wizard is among the
        plotters, and had I any doubt of it, ’twould be
        removed by the appearance there of Henge,
        who, I believe, is up to the elbows in these
        treasons, albeit he hath yet the ear of Cromwell.”</p>

    <p>A wave of color swept over Betty’s face at
        the mention of the obnoxious name.</p>

    <p>“Master Raby,” she said, with embarrassment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
        in her tone, “I have to thank you for
        coming to my aid this night, but I was most
        unhappy to provoke a quarrel between you and
        that man, who is unworthy of your notice.”</p>

    <p>“And did you dream that I would stand by
        to see you annoyed by the rogue?” he answered
        lightly; “I would sooner break his neck.”</p>

    <p>“And I would not grieve were it broken,
        sir,” she said, “though I would not rejoice to
        cause the death of any man, however vile.
        Master Raby, I pray you, let the matter go no
        further; there is no need for you to accept a
        challenge from a rogue.”</p>

    <p>Willing to conceal the true state of affairs,
        Raby smiled.</p>

    <p>“We will not speak of that which pains you,
        Mistress Carew,” he said cheerfully. “A flogging
        at Saint Paul’s Cross would better serve
        the knave than to meet a gentleman, albeit
        Henge is of noble blood.”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty gave him a searching glance.
        Accustomed to the clash of swords and to many
        a wild scene in Devon, she had but few feminine
        fears, yet her heart throbbed at the
        thought of a sword-thrust in the breast of this
        brave gentleman.</p>

    <p>“You are going to fight him,” she said in a
        low voice, “and for me. Alas! I was both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
        foolish and wicked to provoke the quarrel; sir,
        I pray you to forbear.”</p>

    <p>Their eyes met, and she saw a light shining
        in Raby’s that a duller woman could have read.
        A sweet confusion made her stand blushing
        like a timid child.</p>

    <p>“And if I draw not my sword in your quarrel,
        for whom shall I draw it?” he said in a softer
        tone. “Fear not, Mistress Carew, the rogue
        shall have a just chastisement; ’tis not worthy
        of a thought of yours, yet I rejoice to think
        that what I do is not a matter of indifference
        to you.”</p>

    <p>Betty looked up bravely. “Sir,” she murmured,
        “I shall never forgive myself if you
        take hurt in my cause. I pray you let him go;
        ’twas you who were the aggressor, and there
        can be no dishonor in counting the matter too
        unworthy for your notice. For my sake, since
        I made the offence, I do beseech you leave the
        quarrel to oblivion.”</p>

    <p>Raby took her hand and kissed it passionately.
        “For thy sake, mistress, I would do
        all save lose my honor,” he whispered tenderly.</p>

    <p>Betty drew away her hand with a crimson
        face just as Mary Wyatt and Lady Rochford
        came from the queen’s room, and so interrupted
        the tender little scene.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Master Raby, I pray you do me the courtesy
        to bear this missive to Sir Francis,” Mrs.
        Wyatt said in a weary voice; “and then I
        trust that we may all sleep sound till morning
        dawns, and so try to forget this agony.”</p>

    <p>“Has the king come?” asked Lady Rochford;
        “they told me that his grace came late
        last night.”</p>

    <p>“And so he did, madam,” Raby replied, as
        he took Mary Wyatt’s missive and, with a
        salutation which included all, although his eyes
        sought Betty’s, he left the gallery to do his
        errand.</p>

    <p>“To bed, to bed!” said Lady Rochford,
        when the three women were alone; “I am
        well nigh faint for lack of sleep.”</p>

    <p>As they walked together to their chambers,
        Betty turned thoughtfully to Mrs.
        Wyatt.</p>

    <p>“Where was the king’s grace to-day?” she
        asked in a low voice.</p>

    <p>“I know not,” retorted Mary Wyatt, in a
        bitter tone, “but doubtless with that trollop
        Seymour!”</p>

    <p>Betty asked no more questions, but went to
        her own room and said a prayer for the protection
        of Simon Raby from the man she hated;
        and after tossing for a while upon her pillow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
        fell asleep at last, as the first light of the
        winter morning dawned in a gray sky.</p>

    <p>A little later, when the sun was rising, its
        rays shining but faintly through the heavy
        mist that was hanging over the scene, making
        the tall trees of Greenwich Park loom like
        spectral giants through the folds of vapor,
        Simon Raby set out alone to keep his engagement
        with Sir Barton Henge. Armed only
        with his rapier and muffled in a heavy cloak,
        he walked leisurely away from the palace, and
        proceeded through the more lonely portions of
        the park toward the river. His depression of
        the night before had passed with the darkness;
        Queen Anne’s vision concerned him too little
        to disturb his thoughts longer. As he passed
        beyond the immediate vicinity of the palace,
        he quickened his steps. Even at that early
        hour there was the stir of a great establishment
        awakening; he met a company of cooks
        and scullions running toward the royal kitchens,
        and several messengers rode out post-haste, for
        the day’s errands began early.</p>

    <p>The spot appointed for the meeting was on
        the outskirts of the park near the river, and
        took Raby through the loneliest places. The
        morning fog cut off his vision beyond a short
        circuit as he advanced under the trees, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
        after a while all sounds from the palace ceased
        to reach his ears. His path grew narrow as he
        came in sight of the river and was surrounded
        by a low thicket where the underbrush had not
        been cleared away. The beautiful face and
        dark eyes of Mistress Betty filled his mental
        vision, and he walked on, careless of possible
        danger from a treacherous foe; it was not in
        his nature to take any precaution for his own
        safety. He was scarce twenty yards from the
        trysting-place when there was a crackling of
        dead branches on either side of him, and two
        masked men sprang out upon him. Unprepared
        as he was for the onslaught, he was too bold a
        soldier to be disconcerted, and his sword flew
        from the scabbard. Being swift of foot and
        agile, he evaded the heavier of his two assailants,
        and getting his back against a tree, made
        a fair defence. But it was two to one, and he
        had small chance to escape, and saw it. In
        the desperate struggle which ensued, he had
        no time save to parry the blows which were
        aimed at his throat. Then, remembering that
        he was near the river and boats might be passing
        even then, he shouted twice for help even
        while he fought with the courage of despair.
        The black masks with holes, through which
        shone the eyes of his assailants, their silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
        and their determination began to work upon
        him, and the cold perspiration stood out on his
        face. But with marvellous firmness he beat
        back their swords, the gleaming points of
        which began to dazzle his eyes. Once more,
        though sore spent, he shouted, and now there
        was an answer, a cry from the direction of the
        river. At the sound of it the stouter of the
        two villains turned and fled into the thicket,
        evidently having no mind to encounter a reinforcement;
        but the other engaged Raby the
        more fiercely. However, it was now an equal
        struggle, and Simon was giving thrust for
        thrust when a party of strangers broke through
        the thicket from the river side and the mask
        received so sharp a blow on the back of his
        head that he fell prostrate. Looking across
        the body of his stricken assailant, Raby recognized
        with amazement the manly figure of Lady
        Crabtree, her farthingale looped high and displaying
        her huge boots, while a stout staff was
        clasped in the great fist that had dealt the
        blow. Behind her were a group of her attendants
        and some watermen, all gaping at the
        scene in wide-mouthed curiosity.</p>

    <p>“What gear is this, Raby?” she demanded,
        and stirred the unconscious man with her
        foot.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“A small matter, madam,” responded Simon;
        “two villains would have murdered me.”</p>

    <p>At this, the fallen man began to move; and
        Lady Crabtree, bending down, tore the mask
        from the handsome dark face.</p>

    <p>“Henge!” she exclaimed; “a pretty business
        and a pretty rogue! Now have we a
        chance to deliver him to the provost. Here,
        fellows, lend your hands and put this gentleman
        murderer in the barge.”</p>

    <p>“Stay, madam,” said Raby, “this is my
        quarrel; let the villain go. He hath forfeited
        all right to meet a gentleman upon equal
        terms, and if you drag him into court, he will
        but blow abroad a matter which concerns a
        noble lady. Let the brute run to his kennel.
        He comes to himself. Is this your way to fight,
        Sir Barton?”</p>

    <p>Henge staggered to his feet with a muttered
        curse, and groped about for his sword.</p>

    <p>Old Madam pointed to the path that led
        from the palace.</p>

    <p>“Look you, Barton Henge,” she said; “here
        be men enough to lay you by the heels, and if
        you stir a finger, your throat will be slit,
        despite this gentleman who spares you. Go!—and
        swiftly, for my fingers itch to rap your
        pate again, you villain!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“A curse upon you!” answered Henge, as
        he prepared to obey, having no alternative;
        “for once you have outwitted me, but the
        devil take me if you do it again!”</p>

    <p>My lady laughed a shrill, discordant laugh.</p>

    <p>“He hath you, friend,” she said; “go to the
        wizard’s house upon the Thames and worship
        him!”</p>

    <p>Henge gave her a strange look and walked
        sullenly away without a reply.</p>

    <p>“’Twas a chance thrust,” said Lady Crabtree,
        “but it hit—some deviltry is brewing in
        that hole, and I be not mistaken.”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

            <small>BETTY AND HER CHAMPION</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Raby</span> would gladly have parted with old
        Madam at once and made his way on foot to
        the palace, for he did not wish to be seen in
        his disordered dress, and there was blood, too,
        on his face, from a slight cut upon his forehead.
        But she was not of the same mind; she
        would not let him go back alone after his
        encounter, but scolded and badgered him in
        her own fashion, until she forced him into her
        barge. And there she questioned him sharply,
        trying to draw from him the cause of the
        attack which Henge had made; but she failed.
        Simon kept his own counsel; he was as determined
        to keep Betty’s name out of the matter
        as the old woman was resolved to trace it back
        to her, for she had suspected at once the true
        state of affairs. It was an encounter of wits,
        for old Madam was as keen as a needle, and
        Raby was no fool. Back and forth the subject
        went, thrust and parry, until the boat stopped
        at the water-stairs, and there Simon lost no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
        time in making his escape. Lady Crabtree
        was bound for London, intending to return at
        noon to Greenwich; so he evaded her, at least
        for a season. Waving his adieu, he turned
        from the river and made his way swiftly toward
        a side entrance of the palace. The morning
        was now well advanced, and avoiding a group
        of courtiers, he came at last to the quadrangle
        court; and here, to his surprise, he met Mistress
        Carew. She had just come out, roused
        from her slumbers by her anxieties, and a glance
        at Raby told her the story of his morning journey.
        Her quick eye detected the blood that
        he had failed to wipe away entirely, and she
        stopped him with an imperious gesture.</p>

    <p>“You are wounded!” she cried, her tone as
        full of emotion as he could desire; “what have
        you done?”</p>

    <p>“’Tis but a scratch,” he answered lightly;
        “a little water will soon remove the traces
        of it.”</p>

    <p>But she was not to be put off so easily.</p>

    <p>“You have been fighting with Henge!” she
        exclaimed. “I felt it, and I am thankful that
        it is no worse.”</p>

    <p>“You do not inquire into his fate,” Raby
        rejoined, smiling, “yet you know not what
        it is.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Nor care,” she answered, her eyes sparkling
        with anger; “sir, he was unworthy of
        your steel.”</p>

    <p>“That I know now, Mistress Carew,” Simon
        said heartily; “until a few hours ago I believed
        him, after his own fashion, a gentleman,
        save for his pursuit of you, and for that—except
        the manner of it—there is an excuse.”</p>

    <p>“He is too base a man to be aught but a
        coward,” said Betty, scornfully. “But that
        cut upon your forehead,” she added in a
        changed tone, “I grieve to see it; you must
        call a leech.”</p>

    <p>Raby looked at her with a smile, and his
        expression brought the color to her cheeks.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew,” he said softly, “you told
        me the prophecy, and was it not natural I
        should strive for a scar?”</p>

    <p>“But I told you also that I liked it not,” she
        answered archly.</p>

    <p>“Ay, but, then, what if the prophecy held?”
        he said, still smiling. “I thought it safe to be
        on the winning side.”</p>

    <p>“Alas, sir!” she exclaimed, “I fear that
        your heart has already too many scars; add not
        one only to your face.”</p>

    <p>She had stepped back a little and was laughing
        and blushing, her face framed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
        furs that muffled it. He thought her charming,
        and her wayward mood pleased his fancy.</p>

    <p>“Ah, mistress!” he replied, “my heart has
        left my keeping, therefore I have only my face
        to scar, unless you give me back the other.”</p>

    <p>Betty looked down demurely.</p>

    <p>“Master Raby,” she said, “I have been with
        two queens, and both have warned me about
        the hearts of men. One called them ships
        that rode uneasy at their moorings, and the
        other, quicksands. After such goodly advice
        and wise discourse, verily, sir, I have my
        doubts about the matter also.”</p>

    <p>“Then there is greater reason for you to
        listen to a truthful argument,” he answered,
        smiling; “these poor ladies manifestly have
        not found a faithful heart.”</p>

    <p>“That is the very point of the matter,” Betty
        answered quickly; “are any faithful?”</p>

    <p>“Ay, surely,” he answered more earnestly;
        “and mine—”</p>

    <p>“Hush!” exclaimed Betty, softly, “look yonder,
        sir, and judge a man’s heart by the king’s.”</p>

    <p>Raby turned quickly, following the direction
        of her glance. A door on the opposite side
        had opened, and Henry was coming out, followed
        by two of his attendants. The king was
        cloaked, but his figure could not be mistaken;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
        and when Simon turned, he had paused upon
        the threshold and was looking up at a window
        above him. At the casement was the figure of
        a woman, and she waved her hand to the king
        as he looked up. Henry threw her a kiss and
        walked on, followed by his equerries.</p>

    <p>“’Tis not the queen,” remarked Betty softly,
        as the party passed around and out of the
        quadrangle.</p>

    <p>“Nay,” replied Raby, gravely, “it was Mistress
        Seymour.”</p>

    <p>For a moment neither spoke; both were
        thinking of Queen Anne in the wizard’s house,
        both heard again her shriek of terror.</p>

    <p>“Alas!” said Raby; “poor lady! I fear
        there is some truth in the whispers of the
        court.”</p>

    <p>Betty looked at him with a sparkle of mischief
        in her dark eyes.</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she said, “I fear that you have no
        very true witness for a man’s loyalty; you will
        need a better proof.”</p>

    <p>And she made him a little curtsy as she
        turned to go back into the palace.</p>

    <p>“Stay!” cried Raby, eagerly; “I said not
        that a king should be the standard. Why,
        mistress, a royal heart cannot be measured
        with that of a plain, honest man.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Betty laughed archly, still retreating.</p>

    <p>“Is a king, then, the only knave?” she
        asked.</p>

    <p>“There is one heart that waits for you to
        test it, Mistress Carew,” Simon answered, following
        her, his face flushed and his eyes upon
        her laughing ones; it was no longer jest with
        him, but she evaded him.</p>

    <p>They had reached the door which opened
        into the private way to the apartments of the
        maids of honor, and here he was forced to halt.
        She, too, paused an instant, with her hand
        upon the latch, and looked up with serious
        eyes, her whole manner changing in a moment.</p>

    <p>“Master Raby,” she said gently, “I thank
        you from my heart for the part you have taken
        this morning in my quarrel. Believe me, sir,
        the orphan is not ungrateful to her gallant
        champion.”</p>

    <p>Before he could reply, she was gone, and he
        stood looking at the door with a glowing face.
        She had bewitched him and he believed that
        she was not indifferent to him, but she could
        sustain her manner of gay pleasantry, and was
        as skilful as he in the trifling talk which made
        even a serious matter seem of little weight.</p>

    <p>He turned, at last, to find his way to his
        own apartment, determined to bring Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
        Betty to consider the question at a more propitious
        moment; but he was destined to wait
        many days for the opportunity. When he
        reached his room, he found a messenger with a
        summons for him to come without delay to see
        his dying father. There was no time for leave-takings;
        he had to secure the king’s permission
        to depart, and when that was obtained,
        was forced to set out with no better satisfaction
        than a note of farewell to Mistress Betty.
        Not knowing how carefully she kept that missive,
        he went with but poor comfort upon his
        sad errand.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">That</span> strange house upon the Thames, with
        its receding upper stories and its many windows,
        had strange visitors. Not in the daytime;
        then its numerous eyes were often
        blinded with iron shutters, and only the owl’s
        head above the door, which opened on the
        street, indicated the office of its master, as did
        the owl upon the water-gate. At nightfall
        came the never-ending stream of visitors, and
        usually by the river entrance, though there
        were other doors; one, indeed, opening through
        a labyrinth of cellars into a subterranean passage
        which had its outlet somewhere by the
        water’s edge, and whose key was hidden in the
        wizard’s breast. The master of the house quite
        naturally was much sought, being, by repute,
        the greatest necromancer in England and
        shrewd enough to work upon the fancies of the
        common people, dealing out philters and horoscopes
        with a liberal hand; but his real business
        was of a deeper and darker nature. Men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
        of all conditions came by night to that silent
        house, and often one party dreamed not of the
        presence of the other, although the strange,
        small man held intercourse with both. In the
        lower portion of the building, with no communication
        with the stairs by which the queen
        had entered, was a large plain room, furnished
        with a long table and many chairs; and the
        ceiling was dark blue, set with gilded stars, so
        it was called the wizard’s Star Chamber.
        Here were frequently assembled a large company,
        and here the dealings were free from
        sorcery; they savored of a deeper and more
        subtle matter. Here, sometimes, were peers
        of the realm, the vacillating Lord Hussey,
        Darcy, and, less frequently, my lord of Exeter,
        and, once or twice, the master of horse, Sir
        Nicholas Carew. On one occasion, too, appeared
        the pale, fanatical face of a poorer
        gentleman, Robert Aske, who was to lead in
        the Pilgrimage of Grace. In this secret
        chamber of the secret house festered conspiracy,
        undiscovered even by the falcon eye
        of Cromwell. Here were represented the
        remnant of the party of the White Rose, the
        infatuated followers of the Nun of Kent and
        the papists, who flocked to the secret meetings
        where Pole’s book against the king was known,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
        before the king saw it, and was eagerly
        devoured; where the pope’s bulls were quoted,
        while the name of Mary Tudor was coupled
        first with the dauphin and then with Charles V.
        The possibilities of resistance to the crown,
        the downfall of Cromwell and the Archbishop
        of Canterbury, the king’s increasing
        corpulence and the sores upon his legs,—all
        these matters were fruitful of discussion,
        and in the midst of the malcontents, the
        dwarfish figure of the master of the house
        flitted about with fiendish activity. It was in
        his nature to love the brewing of so evil a
        caldron, and he was happiest when he could
        count the greatest number of the peers caught
        in his net. Yet, if he was sincere in anything,
        he was in his devotion to the hope of a
        revival of the old régime. Through the length
        and breadth of the kingdom spread the tendrils
        of conspiracy, while the strong hand of the king
        was on the helm of the ship of state, guiding it
        through troubled waters to a liberty of which
        he, despot that he was, had no conception.</p>

    <p>Through the months of that short winter, the
        procession to the wizard’s Star Chamber continued
        and waxed nightly larger, while at
        Greenwich the king and queen lived estranged,
        and the gossips of the court were busy with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
        matter that they whispered only on the back-stairs
        or in the chimney-corners, while the
        beauty of the queen waned under the frown of
        fortune. A cloud hung over the gayeties of
        the court, while she was nervous, anxious, ever
        suspicious of those about her, and time passed
        heavily with the young maids and court rufflers,
        and there was much secret grumbling. Master
        Raby was still in Sussex; his father was dead,
        but the new Lord Raby could not leave the
        estates unsettled, and he had not yet returned.
        My Lady Crabtree, however, had published
        such an account of the affair in the park that
        Henge was forced to keep in retirement, and
        for a while, at least, Betty was free from
        annoyance.</p>

    <p>April came, and Latimer, the Bishop of
        Worcester, was at Greenwich for a time, and
        in the chapel preached a mighty sermon to the
        unhappy queen. The king was absent, and the
        suite of Anne Boleyn filled the space around
        the pulpit. The great bishop spoke in a clear
        voice, bearing fearless witness to the queen of
        the errors and the sins of a worldly life and
        the penitence by which alone she might hope
        to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, where her
        earthly majesty would be a shackle to her
        immortal soul. The preacher lifted his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
        courageously to call an erring woman to repentance.
        Latimer saw the truth too plainly,
        and was too honest to bear false witness,—a
        great man whom the great cardinal plucked
        from the burning, seeing those qualities of
        soul which a strong mind recognizes even in a
        foe, and Wolsey saved him to be the martyr of
        bloody Mary.</p>

    <p>Queen Anne left the chapel weeping, and
        going to her apartments, bade Mary Wyatt
        bring her Tyndale’s translation of the Bible, the
        book that her intercession with the king had
        saved from the fagots. About her stood her
        maids of honor, and while she sat thus with
        the open Testament before her, tears in her
        eyes and her whole manner full of agitation,
        the door opened to admit a young and beautiful
        woman. In contrast to the pale face of the
        queen, the luxuriant beauty of the new-comer
        seemed dazzling; her features were perfectly
        regular, while her eyes have been called
        “starry” in their luster. At the sight of her,
        Anne’s face changed instantly; she rose, and
        advancing to the center of the room, looked at
        her haughtily. The young woman was splendidly
        dressed, and wore a girdle of pearls at her
        waist, and on her neck a great jewel, which
        attracted the eye of the queen.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“What have you there, Mistress Seymour?”
        she exclaimed sharply, indicating the gem.</p>

    <p>Jane Seymour drew back with a flush of
        mingled embarrassment and indignation.</p>

    <p>“’Tis but a gift, madam,” she said, faltering
        under Anne’s searching glance; “’tis
        naught of importance. I—”</p>

    <p>The blush, the stammering tone were alike
        fatal to an attempt at evasion; the queen
        snatched at the jewel and tore it from her
        rival’s throat with such vehemence that she cut
        her hand upon the clasp and the blood dropped
        on her dress. She took the ornament, and
        looking on the reverse side, found a curiously
        contrived spring, which opened to reveal a
        beautifully painted portrait of the king. For
        one moment she stood transfixed, such an
        expression on her haggard face that her attendants
        shrank back and the fair Seymour was
        covered with confusion. Then the furious
        nature of Anne Boleyn roused her from her
        womanly dismay; she turned upon the maid of
        honor like a lioness at bay, her wrath bringing
        a terrible beauty to her face and her eyes
        blazing with fury. She hurled the bauble at
        Jane Seymour with such force that it fell
        shattered at her feet.</p>

    <p>“Go!” cried the queen, pointing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
        door, “get from my sight, you accursed traitress,
        and take the image of your paramour
        away with you!”</p>

    <p>“Madam, I pray you—” began Jane.</p>

    <p>“Begone!” said Anne, her impassioned
        voice ringing through the room; “doubtless
        the king awaits thee. Lie not to me! let me
        not see thy face again!”</p>

    <p>In her resistless fury the queen towered like
        an avenging spirit, and Jane Seymour could
        only gather up the fragments of her sovereign’s
        love token and retreat in deep confusion.
        Anne Boleyn watched her until the door closed
        behind her, her own pose full of queenly dignity
        and injured womanhood; but when the
        rival beauty had withdrawn, a great change
        swept over Anne’s features; she turned, and
        seeing her favorite friend near her with a face
        full of sympathy and indignation, she fell
        weeping on her neck.</p>

    <p>“Oh, Mary, I have sinned!” she cried in a
        voice of anguish; “oh, my God! is my punishment
        to be administered in like measure with
        my sin?”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

            <small>THE JOUSTS AT GREENWICH</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the first of May; the trees in Greenwich
        Park were budding with the tender tints
        of spring, and the short turf was studded with
        the little daisies, pink and white, and the
        hawthorns were in bloom, while from the
        hedgerows came the music of the birds. In
        the lists at Greenwich the silver trumpets
        blew. The heralds proclaimed the names of
        the challengers and challenged in the tournament.
        The royal gallery was hung with cloth
        of gold, and the king and queen sat there
        together, in apparent concord; yet there were
        dark whispers in the palace, there had been
        a secret session of the privy council at Whitehall
        a few days before, and a gentleman of
        the king’s household had been committed to
        the Tower. But outwardly all was gay for
        the great festival of May Day. Banners floated
        over the lists, pennants of dyes as varied as
        the rainbow, while from the galleries hung rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
        tapestries and wreaths of flowers. Garlands
        decorated the canopy above the head of Anne
        Boleyn, garlands lay on the gallery balustrade
        before her, and she was robed in all the splendor
        of a queen. Her surcoat was of scarlet
        and gold brocade, and her mantle of cloth of
        gold was lined with ermine, while on her coif
        was a circlet of rubies, the same which she had
        worn on that Whitsunday when she received
        the crown. Unusually pale, but beautiful, the
        queen leaned forward in her chair to watch the
        tilting, while beside her sat the king, seeming
        to share her interest in the games. He also
        was arrayed in a regal fashion, his dress of
        purple velvet slashed with white satin and his
        breast covered with jewels, which sparkled
        also in his low-crowned velvet hat, in which
        were set white ostrich plumes. The strong
        face of the king was slightly clouded, though
        he smiled, and his tawny eyes flashed with the
        fiery spirit of his race. About the queen stood
        her maids of honor, Mistress Wyatt, Mistress
        Gaynsford, Betty Carew, and many more; and
        in the rear was the tall, square-shouldered
        Lady Crabtree, who had that day asked Anne’s
        leave to take Betty away to Wildrick, pleading
        some excuse in response to the queen’s inquiries.
        Permission had been given, and when the festivities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
        were ended, Mistress Carew would
        depart for a while from court.</p>

    <p>With the braying of trumpets and the sound
        of music, challenger and challenged rode into
        the lists,—the queen’s brother, Lord Rochford,
        and Sir Henry Norris, who had been one
        of the witnesses of Henry’s secret marriage
        with the Marchioness of Pembroke in the attic
        turret of Whitehall. Both the contestants
        were fine riders, and expert with sword and
        lance; the first encounter called forth a burst
        of applause. Men shouted, women waved their
        handkerchiefs, and the queen let hers fall from
        her hand into the lists. Before the eager host
        of sycophants could reach it, Norris had it,
        and pressing it to his face, presented it on the
        point of his lance to Anne. There was a
        moment of silence; the king rose with a dark
        frown and, followed by a few of his confidential
        attendants, left the gallery without a word
        or a glance at his consort. At the barrier of
        the lists, the royal officers arrested Lord Rochford
        and Sir Henry Norris upon the charge of
        high treason. In an instant the bright scene
        was changed; the trumpets ceased to sound,
        men flocked together, speaking low, the jousts
        were stayed, the women stared affrighted at the
        queen.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“The king! the king!” was whispered;
        “what doth ail the king? Something has happened,
        some mischief is ripe! The Northern
        Counties must have risen! My lord privy seal
        is murdered! These gentlemen have poisoned
        the Princess Elizabeth!”</p>

    <p>Almost a panic reigned below, while in the
        gallery the queen rose with a white face and
        withdrew, followed by her women. In half an
        hour the lists were vacant, the garlands hung
        wilting in the sunshine, the idle crowd trailing
        off full cry after some new scandal. The news
        had spread that the king was gone to Whitehall
        and with him the prisoner Norris. Tales that
        had been whispered began now to be told aloud;
        fingers were pointed at the windows of the
        queen’s rooms; idle gossips watched upon the
        water-stairs for possible arrivals from London,
        and the superstitious remembered signs and
        sounds. A step had been heard upon the
        palace stair at midnight, yet no one ascended,
        though the heavy tread came through the
        gallery before the door of Anne Boleyn; it
        had so walked at that of Catherine, and at the
        threshold of the hapless Anne of Warwick,
        queen of Richard III. One old wife had seen
        Death riding on a tall white horse through the
        park in the full light of noonday. Another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
        who had heard the Bishop of Worcester’s great
        sermon at Paul’s Cross, had been in terror
        ever since, lest England should fall away to the
        Bishop of Rome, so valiantly had his lordship
        preached against friars and abbots, and the like.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the queen was in her own apartments.
        Although deeply disturbed by the
        king’s anger and abrupt departure, she bore
        herself with composure, talking quietly with
        her women, speaking not at all of the arrest of
        her brother. Her maids flocked about her
        startled, dismayed, and each suspicious of the
        other’s fidelity, except the few who were close
        to the person of the queen. Never was a May
        Day so full of trouble since the Ill May Day
        when the poor apprentices of London rose in
        Queen Catherine’s time to be butchered by
        the Duke of Norfolk.</p>

    <p>Night came at last, but sleep visited but
        few in the palace, and the morning found
        many haggard faces about the queen. Yet the
        suspense continued; the daily life at Greenwich
        moved on as usual, men and women tried
        to smile and made ghastly jests. The king
        came not again, and noonday brought no tidings.
        Dinner was spread in the royal apartments,
        and Anne sat down, attended by her
        maids of honor and the servants of her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
        household. The customary greeting from the
        king, “Much good may it do you,” came not,
        and the queen’s face paled as she glanced at
        the sorrowful women about her. More than one
        had tearful eyes, and all failed to respond to
        her attempted pleasantry.</p>

    <p>“Mary,” she said, turning to Mistress Wyatt,
        “what ails thee? One would think that a
        death’s head grinned upon the board. ’Tis a
        dull hour and my maids are red-eyed; truly,
        it seems that they might make some jest to
        entertain the queen.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, madam!” exclaimed Mary Wyatt,
        bursting into tears, “I cannot—I am ill.”</p>

    <p>“Ill?” repeated the queen, sadly; “nay,
        my girl, not ill, but fearful. I knew not that
        thy blood was so weak. When Anne Boleyn
        sees danger approaching, her heart beats with
        a bolder pulse; she feels that she is sprung of
        a warlike race which is not so ill a match for
        the Tudors. Come, come, Mary, dry thy
        tears; the May sun is shining; it is almost as
        fair a day as that first of June on which I made
        my progress through London.”</p>

    <p>“I pray that it may shine on you with greater
        blessing, madam,” replied Mistress Wyatt,
        drying her eyes.</p>

    <p>The queen looked down the long table; at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
        the end one of her old servants stood weeping;
        on either hand were pale faces, even Betty
        Carew had lost her splendid coloring.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew,” said Anne, “why is your
        face so long? I do not think you love me,
        yet your cheek is wan. Is my case, then, like
        the queen’s at Kimbolton?”</p>

    <p>There was a rustle, a stir of amazement, but
        the words were spoken.</p>

    <p>“Madam,” said Betty, in a low voice, “between
        the ill and suffering lady who died
        yonder and your grace’s youth and health there
        can be no comparison.”</p>

    <p>“My Lady Crabtree takes you to Deptford,”
        said Anne, quietly; “’tis well. I would not
        bring disaster upon one so young, and who has
        no cause to love me.”</p>

    <p>“I pray your grace to let me remain,” Betty
        cried, her generous spirit stirred; “I would
        not leave you in the hour of trouble.”</p>

    <p>“Trouble!” the queen laughed hysterically,
        “who speaks of it? ’Tis gay, a festival at
        Greenwich. Hark!” she cried suddenly,
        “what is that?”</p>

    <p>The stir of an arrival in the antechamber,
        the great doors thrown open, the voice of the
        usher announcing his grace of Norfolk and the
        lords of the Privy Council.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Anne rose from her seat with a low cry.</p>

    <p>“’Tis a message from the king’s grace,” she
        cried joyfully; “my lord hath sent to comfort
        me for the arrest of my sweet brother.”</p>

    <p>She stood with a white face, her splendid
        dress disordered, her beautiful hair unbound.
        Her ladies clustered about her, but leaving a
        space in which she stood alone; behind were
        her frightened servants. Toward this group
        came with slow steps, as if their errand was a
        heavy one, her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk,
        Cromwell, the Chancellor Audley, and others
        of the Council. The queen looked at them
        with dilated eyes, her breast heaving, and her
        expression changing from expectation to terror
        as her glance fell on Sir William Kingston,
        the Lieutenant of the Tower.</p>

    <p>“My God!” she cried in a low voice, “there
        is death in their looks!”</p>

    <p>Then she added aloud, “My lords, why come
        ye here?”</p>

    <p>“Madam,” replied Cromwell, sadly, “we come
        at the king’s command to conduct you to the
        Tower, there to abide his highness’s pleasure.”</p>

    <p>Mary Wyatt with a scream clutched at the
        queen’s robe, but in this supreme moment
        Anne regained her self-command. She put
        her devoted maid aside and stood alone.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“My lords, if it be the king’s pleasure,” she
        said, “I am willing to obey.”</p>

    <p>The Duke of Norfolk ordered her attendants
        from the room that she might be examined
        privately by the Council.</p>

    <p>“Uncle,” said the queen, sadly, “from thy
        hands I might look for more tender usage.”</p>

    <p>Before she left the room, Betty Carew
        approached the unhappy woman; the young
        girl’s generous heart beat high and her dark
        eyes sparkled with anger. She saw here only
        a repetition of the blow that had smitten
        Catherine of Arragon.</p>

    <p>“Madam,” she said in a low voice, “if it be
        your wish, I will go with you to the Tower; I
        would not leave you now!”</p>

    <p>The queen was deeply touched; she took a
        ring from her finger and placed it in Betty’s
        hand.</p>

    <p>“Nay, Mistress Carew,” she said gently, “I
        also can be generous; thou art young, go in
        peace. Mary Wyatt and my other maids may
        presently come to me; now I am the king’s
        prisoner. Farewell, fair girl, I pray thy
        beauty may not bring thee to so evil a case.”</p>

            <small>IN THE APPLE ORCHARD</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">My</span> Lady Crabtree hurried Mistress Betty
        from Greenwich. At sunset of that fateful
        day, the two went by water to Deptford. The
        barge glided gently along the placid river;
        the soft spring air was full of fragrance and the
        banks of the Thames on either hand were clad
        in a mantle of varied green, while above the
        blue sky was flecked with rosy clouds. Betty
        and old Madam sat in the center of the boat,
        and the young girl was silent and manifestly
        unhappy. After casting one or two of her
        eagle glances at the beautiful, downcast face,
        Lady Crabtree accosted her with her accustomed
        frankness.</p>

    <p>“What ails you, wench?” she asked sharply;
        “you had no love for this queen when you were
        sent to her, and now you pull as long a face as
        ever you did for the Lady Catherine.”</p>

    <p>“I had only condemnation for her when I
        went first to Greenwich,” Betty answered,
        “nor do I love her as does poor Mary Wyatt,
        and a few of the others also; but it seems a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
        cowardly thing to leave her now—it hurts me
        to seem a time-server.”</p>

    <p>“Tush!” retorted the old woman, calmly,
        “the queen cares naught for you. Nor would
        they let you go if you would. They took her
        to the Tower without even giving her time to
        change her farthingale,—like men it is to do
        it so,—and I hear that the king’s grace will
        have her aunt, Lady Boleyn, and Mrs. Cousins,
        whom she hates, attend her. Doubtless they
        will strive to wring some confession from her,
        poor thing!”</p>

    <p>“She is charged with high treason, so Mary
        Wyatt told me, weeping,” Betty said; “but the
        whole matter has been conducted so secretly
        that the unhappy lady knows not the charges.”</p>

    <p>Lady Crabtree’s stern face stiffened.</p>

    <p>“That may and may not be,” she retorted
        dryly; “Anne Boleyn has been more foolish
        than ever she was wise. The greatest fool was
        she to think that the man whom she had made
        unfaithful to his wife would be faithful to her.
        Poor shallow pate! she but taught him the
        door by which he should slip out. Well, well,
        there will be a great trial, and what will my lord
        of Wiltshire do?”</p>

    <p>“The queen’s father?” Betty said; “alas,
        poor gentleman!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Alas, poor ass!” retorted Lady Crabtree;
        “yet was he clever enough to wring a promise
        from the king’s grace to marry Mistress Anne
        before Queen Catherine was put away. They
        tell a tale of his visit to the Bishop of Rome,”
        she added, laughing. “The king sent him upon
        this business of the divorce, and he, getting
        there, refused to kiss the pope’s toe. ’Tis
        added that his dog bit it, in which case it is
        no great wonder that his highness’s cause
        suffered at Rome.”</p>

    <p>“My Lady Rochford does not love the
        queen,” Betty remarked thoughtfully, “nor
        does the queen love her.”</p>

    <p>“There is gossip about her as a witness
        against Anne,” old Madam replied, “but there
        is scandal enough now to raise the stones of
        the palace. ’Twas the rumor of this matter
        that reached your uncle through his kinsman,
        the master of horse. Whereat I get a letter,
        writ in haste, to tell me to propound some
        excuse to get you to Deptford. William
        Carew must take me for a liar; that I never
        was, because I could not cover one without
        a thousand, and it is a weariness to the
        flesh.”</p>

    <p>There was a pause between them; they were
        approaching Deptford, and Betty’s mind was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
        full of those last melancholy hours with the
        unhappy queen.</p>

    <p>“Hast seen thy lover, Henge, of late?”
        Lady Crabtree asked, as they reached the
        landing.</p>

    <p>Betty raised her head haughtily. “I pray you
        call him by some other name,” she said coldly;
        “I am happy that I have not seen him.”</p>

    <p>“And did Master Raby—I beg his pardon—Lord
        Raby not tell thee of the game in
        Greenwich Park?”</p>

    <p>A deep blush came into Betty’s face.</p>

    <p>“I saw Lord Raby but once before he went
        away,” she answered, “and he told me but
        little, albeit I have heard much since.”</p>

    <p>Taking a grim pleasure in the recital, Lady
        Crabtree told the story of the ambush and the
        rescue, and her sharp eyes did not lose a blush
        or quiver of the face beside her.</p>

    <p>“’Tis a mercy that the matter is so ended,”
        Betty said in a low voice; “now I think he
        will scarcely dare to show his face again.”</p>

    <p>Old Madam laughed harshly. “Little you
        know of Barton Henge,” she said; “he will
        remember the injury and the disgrace until he
        has avenged it. Lay no such unction to your
        soul; he is a devil and he will do a devil’s
        work.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>With these threatening words still ringing
        in her ears, Betty went with a heavy heart to
        take up her life again with this strange woman.</p>

    <p>For a while, however, all hearts were absorbed
        in the terrible tidings that came from
        London. The indictment and the trial of a
        Queen of England, the pitiful spectacle of a
        woman who had sacrificed all to obtain a crown
        now forced to such a shameful ignominy. The
        minds of honest Englishmen were stunned;
        the sadness of the fate of Catherine was as
        nothing compared with this.</p>

    <p>Moved by pity for the wretched queen, awed
        by the recognition of the fearful workings of
        retribution, Betty Carew was filled with amazement,
        sympathy, unbelief. Finding small
        matter in common with old Madam, the young
        girl was much alone. Sitting in her own
        room, which overlooked the river, or walking
        through the garden and orchards of the manor
        house, her mind found plenty of food for reflection.
        In a few short months she had attended
        two queens, each doomed to misery,—one a
        sternly virtuous woman, dying as a Christian
        should; the other—she could not think of
        Anne’s great beauty, the attraction of her
        manner, without commiseration. She had seen
        her in a brief hour of triumph at Catherine’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
        death; she knew that it was commonly reported
        that her malice had pulled down the great
        cardinal, but she could only think of her in
        her distress; she heard still her shrieks in
        the wizard’s house, her anguish at the sight of
        the king’s gift to Jane Seymour.</p>

    <p>Betty had been ten days at Deptford, and
        one morning walked alone in the apple orchard.
        Beneath her feet the soft green turf was broken
        here and there by the gnarled root of an apple
        tree; overhead the low boughs made a network,
        white and pink with bloom, and through
        the beauty of the fragrant blossoms she saw
        the soft blue sky, and before her, through the
        trees, was the river. The birds sang with
        the joy of the spring. She went on down to
        the river bank, and watched the wherries going
        to London; then, as she came slowly back, she
        looked up and saw, coming through the avenue
        of trees, a stalwart figure, and a face she knew.
        She had not seen Simon Raby since that
        morning in the quadrangle court, and she
        blushed a little as she saw the glad look on his
        face. But she had profited by her lessons in
        the world, and she met him with an air of
        demure dignity.</p>

    <p>“You are welcome, my Lord Raby,” she
        said gravely; “you have been long in Sussex,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
        and I was sorry that you went on so sad an
        errand. Sir, I am an orphan too, and do commiserate
        your case.”</p>

    <p>Despite his black garments, Simon Raby was
        wearing a cheerful countenance, having been
        long separated from his father, a close-fisted
        man, whose only love was gold, which had
        made his son run to the opposite extreme.
        Having little in common, Raby had not felt
        his loss too deeply; but at this speech from
        Mistress Betty, he pulled down his face and
        tried to make a proper answer, although all the
        while he was thinking how radiant was her
        dark beauty in the white gown she wore, and
        what a picture she made with the apple-blooms
        overhead and in her hands. And she knew
        his thoughts well enough, but chose to turn
        the talk away.</p>

    <p>“How long have you been back in London?”
        she asked, arranging her flowers; “we have
        been ten days here, but at this dreadful time it
        seems much longer.”</p>

    <p>“Alas, poor queen of a day!” Raby said
        compassionately; “’tis a great misfortune for
        this realm, nor do we see the end of it. I
        came back but yesterday, and heard the tidings
        at an inn. They stunned me; I could not
        believe it until I made inquiries of the matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
        ’Tis said that my lord privy seal sent for Sir
        Francis Bryan, but he is quit of it. And
        Archbishop Cranmer wept; he hath a gentle
        heart. I thought of the wizard’s house, Mistress
        Carew, and of the shrieks of the queen.
        ’Tis a marvellous thing, and makes an honest
        man shun the bandy-legged creature. I passed
        that house as I came on the river; the shutters
        were open and the windows—verily, they
        shone like evil eyes in the sunlight.”</p>

    <p>Betty shuddered. “’Twas a fearful place,”
        she said, and added: “I owe you a debt, Lord
        Raby. My Lady Crabtree told me more of
        that encounter with Henge than ever you did.”</p>

    <p>Raby’s face flushed as he laughed.</p>

    <p>“It was a petticoat rescue,” he said, “of
        which I have little cause to be vainglorious.
        Hath the villain troubled you again?”</p>

    <p>“Nay,” Betty answered, “though my lady
        tells me that he will avenge his grief. I pray
        you, beware of this dangerous foe.”</p>

    <p>“I would right cheerfully encounter more
        such in your cause, Mistress Carew,” he answered
        softly, and then added after a brief
        pause, “I was not only in Sussex; I have been
        down to Mohun’s Ottery.”</p>

    <p>“To my uncle?” asked Betty, in surprise.
        “How fared they all?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Well, and sent loving greetings to you,”
        he replied. “Can you not divine my errand,
        Mistress Carew, down there in Devon?”</p>

    <p>Betty looked up archly, but meeting the
        ardent glance of his brown eyes, looked down
        again and colored like a rose.</p>

    <p>“Nay, sir,” she said, “I never yet could
        read a riddle.”</p>

    <p>A soft breeze shaking the bough overhead,
        some apple blossoms dropped upon her like a
        fragrant snowfall.</p>

    <p>“I saw your uncle, Mistress Carew,” Simon
        said softly, “and I pleaded my cause with him
        and won it; ’tis for you to condemn me now,
        or bless me.”</p>

    <p>They stood near the high wall of the orchard;
        it was very still, and Mistress Betty kept her
        eyes upon the ground.</p>

    <p>He put out his hand and took hers gently;
        his manner was tender as to a child; her stately
        beauty did not make her a great lady in his
        eyes, he saw beyond it the tender heart.</p>

    <p>“Mistress Carew, Betty,” he said softly, “I
        have no scar upon my brow.”</p>

    <p>At this, a smile stole over Betty’s rosy face
        and she gave him an arch glance.</p>

    <p>“You might have had one, sir, but for my
        Lady Crabtree,” she said roguishly.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>He kissed her hands. “I love you,” he
        whispered tenderly; “will you make me happy,
        or must I go hence with a heavy heart?”</p>

    <p>“My Lord Raby,” Betty said quietly, “I
        see my uncle and my Lady Crabtree coming
        through the orchard; did my uncle come with
        you?”</p>

    <p>“I must have my answer,” he exclaimed,
        between hope and doubt, still detaining her
        hand though he heard the others coming.</p>

    <p>“Bethink you,” she said proudly, “I should
        be but a portionless bride.”</p>

    <p>“To me the noblest and the richest in the
        kingdom,” he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>She looked at him with radiant eyes.</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she said roguishly, “my uncle calleth
        thee!”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

            <small>A MESSENGER FROM LONDON</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the strange house upon the Thames, the
        wizard entertained a guest in a small, dark
        room upon the lower floor. There was a low
        chimney in the corner, and on the hearth some
        logs were burning; over it was swung a kettle,
        the steam issuing from its iron lips proclaiming,
        by its unsavory odor, some tea of herbs.
        On the table in the center of the room were
        two sealed packets, one large, the other small,
        and near this table sat the wizard and his
        friend, Sir Barton Henge. The outer shutters
        being closed, there was no light in the place
        except the red glare of the fire which flickered
        on the faces of these two, and cast their
        shadows magnified upon the wall behind. A
        strange couple, strangely fitted for mischief.</p>

    <p>“Anne Boleyn is sentenced,” Henge said
        moodily; “my lord of Northumberland was
        carried fainting from the court.”</p>

    <p>“Let the drab die!” retorted the wizard,
        with indifference; “as for Percy, he is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
        fool. In spite of all, he is firm for the king
        and Cromwell; there are others whom we will
        get. Yet this woman’s death will go far to
        heal the differences between this realm and
        Rome; the pope but fears the emperor, and
        the emperor’s aunt is now avenged. Happily,
        however, the visitation of the monasteries sets
        ill on the stomachs of the common folk.”</p>

    <p>“How like a spider you are!” said Henge,
        watching him. “Sitting here, you weave and
        weave until one fly and then another is caught
        in the meshes of your web, and then you gloat
        over the victim’s struggles.”</p>

    <p>“As you will gloat,” remarked the astrologer,
        “when your victim is caught in the snare
        that you are setting.”</p>

    <p>His dark companion started and looked at
        him uneasily. Even in his bold heart there
        lurked a secret dread of this dwarfish creature’s
        power; the shining eyes, the keen, fox-like
        face were full of cunning, wit, relentless purpose,
        and Henge knew it.</p>

    <p>“What hints are these?” he said roughly.
        “I am not a man to plot as you do; I am no
        schemer, but an open foe.”</p>

    <p>The wizard laughed unpleasantly, lifting his
        brows with a look of incredulity.</p>

    <p>“An open foe?” he remarked placidly; “so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
        so, ’twas open in the park that morning, but
        wherefore the masks, Sir Barton?”</p>

    <p>Henge sprang up with a curse.</p>

    <p>“You spying devil!” he cried; “how came
        you there?”</p>

    <p>At this the little man laughed long and loud,
        rocking to and fro on his stool, tears of merriment
        gathering in his eyes, while his fellow
        conspirator stood staring at him like a wild
        beast at bay.</p>

    <p>“I was not there,” he said at last, wiping
        his eyes, but shaking still with laughter,—“I
        was not there, or I might have engaged my
        Lady Crabtree; an equal match we would have
        made. Sit down, my son, ’tis no time for
        such quarrels; I know too much, too much!”</p>

    <p>Henge stared at him, his hand fondly fingering
        his sword.</p>

    <p>“Ay, curse you!” he said, between his
        teeth; “you know too much, but so do I, Sir
        Wizard!”</p>

    <p>“Only that which would cost you your head
        long before it harmed a hair of mine,” the
        little man replied calmly, while he rose and
        stirred the beverage in the kettle.</p>

    <p>“What devil’s broth is that?” Henge cried,
        turning away in disgust; “it stinks like some
        filthy gruel brewed for death.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Nay,” said the wizard, smiling, “’tis not
        poison; thought you to see me boiled like
        Richard Rouse? When this is thoroughly
        compounded, the smell of it stealing in a man’s
        brain will make him forgetful for a space;
        ’twill be useful to you, and the cost is trifling
        for the purpose, a hundred guineas.”</p>

    <p>Henge shuddered. “I have no use for it,”
        he said hoarsely, “while I have a sword or a
        knife. Keep your devil messes for your richer
        clients.”</p>

    <p>Suddenly there was a deep boom, and the
        house shook, the windows rattled.</p>

    <p>The wizard took from the table a wine-glass
        which stood filled, and raised it in the air.</p>

    <p>“My Lady Anne, once Queen of England,
        your health!” he said, and drank it.</p>

    <p>Henge watched him with a look of dread.</p>

    <p>“’Tis the signal that she is beheaded,” he
        said with a ghastly face; “why drink the
        health of a dead woman?”</p>

    <p>The little man grinned. “Why not?” he
        asked. “I may the sooner conjure her to
        speak to thee.”</p>

    <p>“The fiend take thy conjuring and thy
        visions!” exclaimed Henge, uneasily; “keep
        them to frighten petticoats.”</p>

    <p>Sanders chuckled maliciously. “You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
        a great scorn of petticoats since a woman
        rapped your pate,” he said.</p>

    <p>“Curse you!” cried Sir Barton; “because
        you have me in your power, would you insult
        me? Did you send for me to-day for this sole
        purpose, your amusement?”</p>

    <p>“Nay,” retorted the wizard, calmly, “you
        came for your instructions. Yonder lie the
        packets,—one to carry to our friends in Yorkshire,
        where, my lord privy seal having so
        roughly handled the jury, they are ripe for us;
        the other packet, being on your person, may be
        found, if need be, ’tis but a bluff.”</p>

    <p>“A likely errand,” said Henge, bitterly,
        “when Cromwell’s spies are thick as harvest
        gnats. Verily, I thank you, Sir Wizard, but I
        made no such bargain.”</p>

    <p>Sanders put out his hands with a deprecating
        gesture.</p>

    <p>“As you will,” he said grimly; “there are
        others, and doubtless if your visit to the Lady
        Mary was known—”</p>

    <p>Henge sat staring at the packets; in his
        mind had flashed a scheme so devilish that he
        was fascinated. For the moment, even the
        wizard’s covert threats fell on deaf ears; suddenly
        the possibility of vengeance, on a larger
        scale than he had dreamed, intoxicated his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
        brain. The scheme was born full grown; he
        had but to execute it.</p>

    <p>“I will take the packets,” he said, wetting
        his dry lips with his tongue; “I did but jest.”</p>

    <p>The wizard regarded him uneasily; something
        in the sudden change of manner displeased
        him, yet he knew the man to be too
        deeply committed for retreat.</p>

    <p>“You have a pleasant way of jesting,” he
        remarked dryly, “a gentle playfulness. What
        is your haste?”</p>

    <p>Sir Barton had risen and gathered up the
        packets.</p>

    <p>“The fumes of your vile drug intoxicate
        me,” Henge said curtly; “I must breathe in
        the open air or choke.”</p>

    <p>The wizard smiled and gazed fondly at his
        kettle.</p>

    <p>“’Tis useful stuff,” he replied, “most useful.”</p>

    <p>Sir Barton took up his cloak and sword,
        eager to be off.</p>

    <p>“Some day you will fall into your own caldron,”
        he remarked; “but I tell you, Sanders,
        that I will not be there too.”</p>

    <p>The little man rubbed his hands, laughing
        wickedly.</p>

    <p>“How can you know? ’Twould be a warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
        meeting,” he said, and stood still laughing
        when Henge closed the door upon him.</p>

    <hr class="tb">

    <p>At Deptford, on that fair nineteenth of May,
        the household at Wildrick waited for tidings.
        In the warm sunshine they stood upon the
        terrace facing the river,—old Madam, Sir
        William Carew, Betty, and Lord Raby.</p>

    <p>“There was some confession to my lord of
        Canterbury,” Carew said, walking to and fro
        and looking curiously at the river; “’tis hoped
        that a bill of divorcement may save the
        sentence.”</p>

    <p>“If she be guilty, she deserves the sentence,”
        remarked Lady Crabtree, sternly; “if she be
        innocent, she should stand acquitted. She
        was tried by her peers.”</p>

    <p>“I would it were not a woman,” Sir William
        said uneasily. “I like not the death on the
        block of a woman and a queen.”</p>

    <p>“Would you rather burn her?” asked old
        Madam, coolly. “I know not why a woman,
        being wrong, should be less punished than a
        man, or more so. Men are quick enough to
        break a woman’s heart, but over-squeamish
        about breaking her neck.”</p>

    <p>“Yonder comes your messenger,” Lord Raby
        said, pointing to the river, where a wherry had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
        stopped at the water-gate and a manservant in
        Lady Crabtree’s livery was seen disembarking.</p>

    <p>The messenger came up the terrace, and
        pausing in front of the group who waited so
        eagerly for tidings, he lifted his cap.</p>

    <p>“The Lady Anne Boleyn died on the Tower
        green at noon to-day,” he said in a monotonous
        tone; “the king’s grace will wed to-morrow
        the worshipful lady, Jane Seymour. Parliament
        will meet to pass a new Act of Succession.”</p>

    <p>There was a silence; Betty turned and went
        weeping into the house. Simon Raby played
        nervously with his sword. Sir William looked
        about him with a stern face.</p>

    <p>“He is the King of England,” he said with
        stubborn loyalty, raising his hat. “God save
        the king’s grace and give the realm a prince!”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” retorted my Lady Crabtree, bitterly,
        “and God pity his wives!”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

            <small>MY LORD PRIVY SEAL</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Lord Raby</span> and Mistress Carew walked up
        and down the terrace before Wildrick Hall,
        while at the water-stairs a barge waited to take
        him to Whitehall. Her white gown fluttered
        in the soft breeze as she walked, and in her
        eyes shone the light of the spring sunshine.</p>

    <p>“I go to arrange my affairs,” he said, “so
        that I may ride with you and your uncle to
        Mohun’s Ottery to-morrow. Happily, there is
        naught to detain me else, dear heart. I fear I
        should forget my duty for your sake.”</p>

    <p>Betty smiled. “You will need to be prompt,”
        she said lightly; “my uncle waits for no man
        and is ever beforehand with time.”</p>

    <p>“’Twould be a shame on me to be a laggard
        at such a time,” he answered. “Ah, Betty,
        how different the world looks when love
        touches it with golden fingers! I do think
        that I bear no man malice or ill-will, but rather
        would be friends even with mine enemies, but
        never with thine.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>A cloud passed over her face. “I pray you,”
        she said slowly “remember to avoid Barton
        Henge. My Lady Crabtree predicts that he
        will yet endeavor to do us some great mischief,
        and it makes me uneasy for you.”</p>

    <p>“Fear not for me, my love,” he replied
        tenderly; “and as for you, surely the love that
        enfolds you shall ward off this snake. But I
        will be mindful of your fears, albeit I think he
        will avoid me as he would a pestilence.”</p>

    <p>“I know not,” she said, shaking her head;
        “my heart is full of misgivings when I
        think of how he set upon you like a cut-throat.”</p>

    <p>“And I cannot but rejoice that you are
        anxious,” he said softly, “since it shows that
        my safety concerns you.”</p>

    <p>She looked at him with a tender light in
        her eyes.</p>

    <p>“’Tis more to me than my own,” she said
        very low.</p>

    <p>He kissed her hand passionately, although
        Sir William Carew was coming down the walk
        toward them.</p>

    <p>“Your love,” he said, “has made a new life
        for me. I swore when I left Raby Castle that
        I would not return until I brought it the fairest
        mistress in all England.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Alas, sir,” she answered, smiling, “’twas
        a foolish oath, and not likely to be fulfilled.”</p>

    <p>Without regarding their feelings, Sir William
        Carew cut short their talk, which might
        have continued long; for they were lovers, and
        knew how to make much of a little matter.
        He held a package of papers in his hand, sealed
        with red seals, and gave it to Raby.</p>

    <p>“I would have that sent by a sure hand to
        Cromwell,” he said; “it pertains to some
        matters of the county of Devon and claims his
        eye, yet is not so important that I need take
        it in person.”</p>

    <p>“It shall be delivered directly,” Raby replied,
        putting it in his breast; “’tis time I
        went, doubtless you came to remind me.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” Carew answered, smiling; “I remember
        the days when I lingered so. It is nearly
        noon, however, and you were to have gone an
        hour since.”</p>

    <p>“My excuse is so admirable that I deserve
        forgiveness,” Simon said, laughing; but he
        hastened his farewells, and in a few moments
        he and Sir William were walking to the water-stairs
        together, while Betty waved her handkerchief
        from the terrace.</p>

    <p>“You have your rogue yet with you, I see,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
        Carew remarked, his eye lighting on Raby’s
        groom.</p>

    <p>“Shaxter?” Simon replied, smiling; “ay, I
        had forgotten your prejudice. He is a useful
        fellow.”</p>

    <p>“He looks it!” said Carew, with a shrug;
        “farewell, and forget not the packet.”</p>

    <p>Looking back as the barge swept away, Raby
        saw the tall white figure on the terrace and
        the fluttering of her handkerchief. The picture
        of the great stone house, the green slope of the
        terrace, and the beautiful girl waving him farewell,
        framed itself in his mind and was a solace
        to him in the months which followed.</p>

    <p>He was so light-hearted that he whistled to
        himself as the boat went on to London. The
        river was full of water-craft, and the scene was
        gay. The same river that had borne the unhappy
        Anne Boleyn to the Tower smiled in
        the sunshine and rippled gleefully from the
        strong strokes of the oars. Life was full of
        sweetness to Simon Raby, and he sat in the
        boat with a smiling face and a ready greeting
        for any chance acquaintance. In the afternoon
        he would go to my lord privy seal in person,
        now he had matters of his own to attend to.
        He must go to his haberdasher’s and his
        barber’s; he had a dozen errands, and presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
        found dust upon his clothes and went to his
        old lodgings to change them. Shaxter was
        with him as usual and helped him to make the
        change; he put on a rich suit of satin with a
        short cape of velvet, and bidding his attendant
        remain in his apartments until his return, made
        his way down the stairs alone and opened the
        street door. Looking out into the road, he
        saw no one, and came out humming a new
        song, popular at court. He had taken but two
        or three steps when three men stepped out
        from under an adjacent arched doorway. They
        barred his progress, and he looked in surprise
        to recognize the captain of the watch.</p>

    <p>“What now, Ludlow?” he said; “I need a
        little leeway to pass your company.”</p>

    <p>“My Lord Raby, you are arrested!” was the
        reply, as the officer laid a heavy hand upon his
        shoulder.</p>

    <p>Raby drew his sword. “You villain!” he
        said, “this will be a sorry jest for you.”</p>

    <p>“I arrest you in the king’s name,” repeated
        the captain, sharply; but so angry was Simon
        that for a moment they grappled, and the
        officer’s assistants were forced to take part in
        disarming the furious nobleman.</p>

    <p>“Of what avail is this resistance, my lord?”
        cried Ludlow. “I tell you, as your friend, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
        had best submit. I was ordered to take you
        and must, sorely against my will.”</p>

    <p>“Upon what charge?” demanded Raby,
        fiercely; “’tis an evil time if an innocent
        man may not walk safe upon the streets of
        London.”</p>

    <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders. He
        was a kindly, honest man, but he could only
        discharge his office.</p>

    <p>“I have the warrant for your arrest, my
        lord,” he answered soberly, “from my lord
        privy seal; but the reason of it?” he raised
        his brows, “you must ask the man who set the
        trap, not him who merely springs it. Verily,
        Lord Raby, I trust it may be no great matter,
        for your own sake. Mayhap you know well
        what folly brought it.”</p>

    <p>“Not I,” said Simon, angrily; “’tis an
        insult. Where are you taking me, Sir
        Captain?”</p>

    <p>“To my lord privy seal,” he answered,
        glancing with some compassion at the prisoner’s
        indignant face; “belike he has some questions
        to ask. But come, here I linger talking like
        a featherpate, and Cromwell waits. I would
        have left you your sword, my lord, but that
        you were so thirsty for blood.”</p>

    <p>“I will go quietly,” Raby said, in great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
        perplexity and wrath; “it was foolish to fly at
        thy throat for nothing, but it makes my blood
        boil.”</p>

    <p>“For that I do not blame thee,” the officer
        replied, “though it doth usually make a man’s
        blood run cold.”</p>

    <p>“You speak for a guilty man,” said Raby,
        sharply; “no honest man would shiver at an
        insult.”</p>

    <p>There were but few more words exchanged,
        the little company closed up about the prisoner,
        and the walk through the streets was a rapid
        one. Many stared, and some insulting jests
        were made. It was no uncommon sight; disloyalty
        was rife enough to make the arrest of a
        nobleman a matter of usual occurrence. They
        passed some of the gay young gentlemen of
        the court, who looked aside on seeing their
        acquaintance in such company. He was taken
        to Cromwell’s house, and waited but a little
        while at the door before he was brought before
        him.</p>

    <p>Cromwell was in his private room sitting at
        a table by the window, and a large mass of
        papers lay before him. It was his custom to
        apply himself closely to business, and much of
        it was transacted by his own hand. Here was
        a man who held the threads of many conspiracies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
        whose falcon eye was peering into every
        secret lurking-place from Land’s End to the
        Tweed, whose relentless grip closed on the
        traitor like a vise. His back was to the light
        where he sat, so that his strong face was in the
        shadow, but his penetrating eyes were bent on
        Raby at his entrance with a not unkindly look.</p>

    <p>“Master Raby, I had it in my mind to send
        you some advertisement of my regret at your
        father’s death,” he said gravely, “when this
        charge was lodged against you, to my infinite
        surprise.”</p>

    <p>“Sir, I am ignorant of the cause of my
        arrest,” Raby replied, “nor can I imagine
        what accusation has been made against me.”</p>

    <p>“You are charged with high treason,” Cromwell
        said, turning over some papers before
        him, “having conspired with certain persons
        against the safety of the realm, and the life of
        the king’s grace.”</p>

    <p>The expression of amazement deepened on
        the prisoner’s face.</p>

    <p>“My lord,” he said, “I am dumbfounded; I
        have been absent more than two months in
        Sussex, busy with the settlement of my father’s
        estate, which, as I think you know, was much
        in need of my administration. As for consorting
        with conspirators—you, who have known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
        me from my boyhood, should know the folly of
        the charge. I thought my loyalty to the king’s
        highness was established by faithful service.
        This accusation is but the baseless falsehood
        of mine enemies.”</p>

    <p>“My Lord Raby, my heart inclines to believe
        you; I have ever held a good opinion of your
        family,” Cromwell rejoined, “but the nature of
        this charge doth not allow it to be overlooked.
        But ye shall have an ample hearing. Sir,
        there is a strange house here upon the Thames,
        I think you know it,—I see you do,—the
        house of the wizard, Zachary Sanders. You
        were there one night this winter, and upon
        what business?”</p>

    <p>Raby’s face had changed at the mention of
        the wizard’s house; the shrieks of Anne Boleyn
        had a strange trick of haunting him.</p>

    <p>“I was there indeed,” he said frankly, knowing
        no harm could come now of the truth,
        “with Queen Anne and her ladies. It was an
        unhappy whim of the queen’s, and the wizard
        caused her to see so evil a vision that I was
        near seizing him as a traitor; would, indeed,
        have delivered him to the guard but for her
        grace, who would not have the matter known,
        fearing the king’s displeasure at her folly.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell’s face clouded at the mention of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
        Anne. He had seen her die, sent to perform
        that duty by the king, and the man who had
        been faithful to Wolsey, in the misery of
        Esher house, was not without compassion.</p>

    <p>“What was the queen’s vision?” he asked
        moodily.</p>

    <p>“She saw her life, and her death upon the
        block,” Simon replied; “and the poor lady
        was thrown into such terror that she would by
        no means be quieted, and for hours her shrieks
        were heard at Greenwich. By Saint Thomas!
        they ring yet in my ears.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell was silent for a while; evidently
        the frankness and sincerity of Raby, together
        with his previous knowledge of him, made it
        difficult to reconcile the man with the
        accusation.</p>

    <p>“I will be frank with you, sir,” my lord
        privy seal said, at last; “I make no effort to
        conceal the perils of this realm, you know
        them. My Lady Mary Tudor, by her stiff-necked
        attitude toward the king’s grace and
        the Act of Succession, hath made herself a
        stumbling-block, and a point round which the
        malcontents may gather. Then there are the
        papists, ever stirring in the cause of the Bishop
        of Rome, and with these the country gentlemen,
        who detest the breaking up of the monasteries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
        and the abbeys, with no profit to
        themselves, and the travelling friars, and, God
        wot, I know not who, to stir up mischief
        which would bring us swift to civil war. At
        such times, my Lord Raby, I may not be
        lenient. The charge against you is so grave
        that I would have you make a clean breast of
        the matter. You came to town this morning
        from Deptford; what was your errand?”</p>

    <p>Raby thought at the instant of Sir William’s
        packet and put his hand in his doublet and
        drew it out.</p>

    <p>“My lord, I came to attend to some matters
        of my own, of a petty nature, but mainly to
        attend the king’s grace and also to give you
        these papers.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell stretched out his hand for the
        packet and broke the seals without waiting for
        further explanation from Lord Raby. He
        unfolded the wrappers and began to go through
        the papers without making any comment.
        Simon, watching his grave face, read nothing
        after the first quick flash of surprise. Of the
        nature of Carew’s communication, Raby was
        ignorant, but believing it to refer wholly to
        affairs in Devon, he did not greatly concern
        himself about it. His mind was but too
        actively engaged with the state of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
        fortune. His arrest had been so sudden, so
        entirely without reason, that he found no immediate
        solution of his difficulty. He noticed
        that Cromwell, with all his apparent frankness,
        held back the full substance of the charge
        against him, and the names and condition of
        his accusers. Secure in his own innocence,
        Raby did not doubt his ultimate exculpation,
        but he knew not what course to pursue, whose
        name to mention, fearing to drag others into
        his misfortune. While these thoughts passed
        rapidly through his mind, Cromwell was deeply
        engaged in the perusal of Sir William’s
        packet; every paper was carefully examined
        and some were read twice over. Simon began
        to think that Carew’s business would indefinitely
        prolong his own suspense, when the
        king’s minister looked up. However, he did
        not address Raby; his face was inscrutable;
        he touched a bell upon the table and immediately
        an attendant replied to the summons.</p>

    <p>“Call Captain Ludlow,” he said calmly;
        then turning to Raby, he looked at him with
        cold eyes. “Sir,” he said, “you gave me the
        wrong packet.”</p>

    <p>Simon returned the look with surprise.</p>

    <p>“I had but the one, my lord,” he said.</p>

    <p>The officers had entered at Cromwell’s orders.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“If you had but one, you did a strange thing
        to give it to me,” said my lord privy seal; then
        to the captain of the watch, “Ludlow, remove
        Lord Raby under strong guard to the Tower to
        await his examination.”</p>

    <p>Taken by surprise at the entire change in
        Cromwell’s manner, Simon was about to say
        that the papers were from Carew, when a
        second thought made him hesitate. If Sir
        William’s name was not upon them it would
        be strange indeed, and he did not wish to
        bring him under greater displeasure.</p>

    <p>“My lord,” he cried, “I pray you to remember
        that I was but the bearer of those papers;
        I am ignorant of their purport.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell’s face was both incredulous and
        unrelenting.</p>

    <p>“You are not the man to bear such papers
        ignorantly, Raby,” he said harshly; “who
        gave them to you?”</p>

    <p>Simon started; then Sir William’s name did
        not appear. A horrible doubt assailed him,
        but he was a man of stubborn loyalty to his
        friends. He closed his lips; if his silence
        could shelter Carew it was well, especially
        since he was groping in the dark.</p>

    <p>Cromwell, who had waited one impatient
        moment for his answer, smiled grimly. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
        had seen too many men turn traitors to feel
        amazement at the aspect of one.</p>

    <p>“You are tongue-tied,” he said sternly,
        “It may be we must enforce the matter from
        you,” he added, touching the papers; “never
        saw I a greater batch of treason in so little
        space.”</p>

    <p>“My lord, I am innocent!” exclaimed
        Raby; “I—”</p>

    <p>“Remove the prisoner,” Cromwell interrupted
        coldly, making a sign to his officers,
        and returning to his work without another
        word or glance at the nobleman.</p>

    <p>A short while afterwards, Simon Raby entered
        at the water-gate of the Tower, and its
        gloomy doors closed upon him, shutting out
        the beauty and the fragrance of the summer
        world and separating him from the woman he
        loved. The king’s prisoner, charged with high
        treason, had little cause to rejoice in his lot.</p>

            <small>MISTRESS BETTY USES HER WHIP</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Tidings</span> of an arrest for high treason travelled
        but slowly. The movements of the government
        were swift and secret. A man might be
        pounced upon, examined, committed to prison,
        and his own family be unconscious of his situation.
        It was a golden opportunity for the false
        witness; for the public gratification of private
        malice. The marvellous stories told at the
        trials showed the luxuriance of the popular
        imagination.</p>

    <p>No intimation of Lord Raby’s fate reached
        the household at Deptford. He had been
        expected to return almost immediately, but he
        came not, and his absence was attributed to
        some unlooked-for business. At first, Sir
        William threatened to set out for Devon without
        him, but seeing his niece’s disappointment
        and remembering that Raby had accepted a
        commission from him, he decided to wait,
        although he chafed under the delay.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>The third day after Raby’s departure, Mistress
        Betty was riding through the fields behind
        Lady Crabtree’s house. She had been out with
        her uncle and was returning alone by a short
        cut, leaving Sir William some distance behind,
        engaged in conversation with an acquaintance.
        The meadow through which Betty rode lay
        behind the orchards and was skirted on the
        right by a copse of beech-trees. She was
        walking her horse and had come nearly to the
        middle of the field, when a man stepped out
        from the shadow of the trees. At first, taking
        him for one of old Madam’s household, she did
        not notice him, and it was not until he had
        fairly placed himself before her horse that she
        recognized Sir Barton Henge. Her animal
        stopping of its own accord, Henge caught the
        bridle and for the moment held her prisoner.
        She was not naturally fearful and her only
        feeling was one of indignation.</p>

    <p>“Let go the bridle, sir!” she said angrily;
        “what right have you to stop me?”</p>

    <p>“I have tidings for you, fair mistress,” Sir
        Barton replied, with an evil smile upon his
        handsome face; “tidings of my Lord Raby,
        which are for your ear alone.”</p>

    <p>“Sir, loose my horse!” she cried, vainly
        endeavoring to drive the animal forward or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
        one side, but Henge was too strong for her
        and held the creature’s head.</p>

    <p>“You seem not over-anxious to hear tidings
        of your lover,” he said mockingly; “yet it may
        be that you will presently find it difficult to
        get any more.”</p>

    <p>Something in his manner, more than his
        words, drove the blood to her heart. What
        had this wretch done? Where was Simon
        Raby? Yet so little was she like other women
        that she forbore to cry out or ask a question.
        She sat her horse like a statue, her face white
        and her great dark eyes fixed on her tormentor.
        She scorned him, scorned even his power to
        injure her, and he saw it and hated her the
        more; for between this wild passion, that such
        men call love, and hatred there is but a single
        step. Her beauty set his blood on fire, her
        scorn of him awoke every evil impulse in his
        breast and made him long to humble her.</p>

    <p>“So,” he said, with keen anticipation of
        the pain he had in store for her, “you have no
        questions to ask, and Simon Raby’s fate is a
        matter of indifference to you? ’Tis well; it
        would be a shame to spoil those bright eyes
        with tears—even for a lover.”</p>

    <p>She set her teeth and struck her horse upon
        the flank; the animal plunged, but Henge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
        held him yet. She looked back wildly for aid,
        but she could not see her uncle. What folly
        had made her ride on alone?</p>

    <p>“Well, well, I must tell you,” Henge said,
        smiling in evil triumph, “since you are too
        shy to ask. Lord Raby is in the Tower.”</p>

    <p>She knew the man to be a villain, yet something
        in his manner convinced her that he
        spoke the truth. Raby’s long absence was
        explained, and a chill of horror crept over her,
        but her pride sustained her resolution.</p>

    <p>“He was taken the day he left you here,”
        continued Henge, a little baffled by her manner
        and her silence; “he is charged with high
        treason and is like to suffer for his sins. All
        these years he has but fawned upon the king’s
        grace to betray him. A traitor and a pretty
        rogue, this lover of yours, Mistress Carew!”</p>

    <p>Wrath overcame Mistress Betty’s womanly
        fears; in her right hand she held a stout whip,
        and she sat upright in her saddle, looking like
        a beautiful young fury.</p>

    <p>“You knave!” she cried; “you lying knave!”
        and she struck him full across the face, below
        the eyes, with such sudden violence that he
        relaxed his hold, and her horse plunging, set
        her free, and dashed away across the field,
        while Sir Barton Henge stood staring after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
        her, a curse upon his lips and on his face the
        great red welt that followed her lash. And she,
        riding to the house, dismounted, and running
        into the hall, fell on her knees before old
        Madam, and hiding her face in her lap, cried
        out that Simon Raby was in the Tower.</p>

    <p>“Yea, I know,” said my lady, calmly, “and
        they have taken the wizard, Zachary Sanders;
        ’tis a pretty mess. Come, my wench, tears
        will not mend the matter nor unlock the jail.”</p>

    <p>As she spoke, Sir William came in, fresh
        from a gallop across the fields, and smiling;
        but at the sight of Betty’s white face and the
        frown between old Madam’s brows, he stopped.</p>

    <p>“What means this?” he asked; “you look
        as if you had seen a corpse-light.”</p>

    <p>“There be tidings from London,” Lady
        Crabtree answered; “Lord Raby hath gone to
        the Tower accused of high treason.”</p>

    <p>Amazement tied Sir William’s tongue; he
        seated himself opposite his cousin and waited
        for an explanation, his honest face much
        clouded. Lady Crabtree spread out a letter
        on her knee and prepared to read the
        news.</p>

    <p>“This comes from Mistress Gaynsford, Queen
        Anne’s maid,” she said, her open hand resting
        on the long roll of parchment; “she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
        a gossip, but I doubt not the truth of the
        matter.”</p>

    <p>“Let us hear it, Zenobia,” Carew returned
        impatiently.</p>

    <p>“She says of the arrest,” began my lady,
        reading, “‘Lord Raby was taken on a charge,
        secretly preferred to my lord privy seal, and
        on examination, a packet was found on his
        person, filled with treasonable papers, and
        exposing the network of a huge conspiracy.
        Many names were on a list therein; whose we
        know not, but Cromwell and the king’s grace
        have the papers, and doubtless many tremble
        in the fear of apprehension. No one knows
        where the lightning hath struck or who is
        spared, but ’tis said the gentlemen in the
        northern counties are many of them singed.
        The strangest part of the matter is that there
        runs a story that Raby gave this budget to my
        lord privy seal himself with every show of
        innocence, and when it was thought that he
        did it through an error, having two upon his
        person, he was searched, but none other was
        found; and what madness made him give this
        to Cromwell, no man can devise.’”</p>

    <p>“’Tis passing strange,” remarked Sir William;
        “where was my packet?”</p>

    <p>“‘These papers,’” continued old Madam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
        reading, “‘contained such full betrayal of the
        wizard Sanders, who so frightened the late
        queen, that the order for his arrest was
        given. The fashion in which he was taken
        will furnish you with entertainment withal.
        The man who played the informer, in the first
        instance, before Raby’s arrest, had mastered
        almost every secret of the strange house upon
        the river. He told the officers of the guard
        who went to take the astrologer that there was
        a tunnel from the cellar of the house, and that
        they must guard first the outlet of that before
        they strove to force the upper part. The
        entrance in the house he had never found,
        but the outlet by the river he knew. They
        said ’twas scarce larger than a mole-hill and
        cleverly concealed. Well, here sat down three
        of the king’s men, while others went and
        searched the house. There they were transfixed
        by terror, for when each one looked in that
        magic mirror, he saw the devil, horns and
        hoofs and tail, but when they all looked, it
        was blank. A young page with them had a fit
        from fright. ’Tis said by some that it is only
        too faithful a glass. They found not the
        wizard, nor was there a bit of writing there.
        But the trio by the hole in the ground had
        better luck. Out of it the magician appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
        so suddenly, and was so near the color of the
        earth in his russet cloak, that he frightened
        them so much that two fell sprawling in the
        river mud, and had not the third been a big
        man and valiant, my lord wizard would have
        escaped. They have him now safe in the
        Tower, though ’tis said he rides out of it each
        night upon a moonbeam and returns when the
        cocks are crowing.</p>

    <p>“‘How came my Lord Raby to conspire with
        this man? I remember that he and Francis
        Bryan were ready to slit his throat the night
        the queen took her fright. Yet ’tis said that
        the case is clear enough, and there is some
        wonder when the trial will come off.</p>

    <p>“‘The court is dull; Queen Jane is not
        yet crowned, though there is constant talk of
        it. She will have no maids save those who
        wear a girdle of over a hundred and twenty-five
        pearls. Anne Basset had one from her
        mother, Lady Lisle, of a hundred and twenty,
        and she could not appear in it. The king’s
        leg is said to be worse than reported; he is
        fond of the queen, whom some think fairer
        than Anne; she can, at least, wear more fine
        clothes at once and look better, while Queen
        Anne was more beautiful in simple robes.
        This queen is very gracious to the Lady Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
        Tudor and ’tis thought will win upon the
        papists. She is—’”</p>

    <p>“Oh, hush!” ejaculated Carew; “the woman’s
        pen is worse than her tongue. I must
        to London to see what can be done for Raby;
        ’tis a bad business, and I understand it not.”</p>

    <p>All the while, Mistress Betty had listened
        with a pale face, resolution growing in it as
        the matter unfolded itself. She did not speak
        of Barton Henge; his part in it sank into
        insignificance now.</p>

    <p>“Uncle,” she said firmly, “I will go with
        you.”</p>

    <p>“What, wench?” he said in surprise; “of
        what use would you be?”</p>

    <p>“Nevertheless, deny me not,” Betty said;
        “I would go and, at least, I will not hinder
        you.”</p>

    <p>“Let her have her way, William,” Lady
        Crabtree said; “the girl’s face will help you,
        and she is in a mood to fret out her heart
        here.”</p>

            <small>LOVE AT THE TRAITOR’S GATE</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Sir William Carew</span> and Mistress Betty
        were both kindly received by Cromwell. He
        gave them a private audience, and Betty sat in
        the window recess in silent suspense, while
        her uncle talked with the king’s minister.
        Cromwell’s face was calm and inscrutable;
        Carew’s deeply furrowed with anxiety. The
        one was master of the situation, the other
        exceedingly perplexed and doubtful of a way
        in which to help his friend.</p>

    <p>“My lord,” he said gravely, “I come to
        inquire into the arrest of Simon Raby, and
        to know the fate of certain papers that he bore
        of mine.”</p>

    <p>“He was arrested upon the charge of high
        treason,” Cromwell replied, “and I regret to
        say that, upon examination, the evidence
        against him was materially strengthened. I
        regret it exceedingly, for I knew his father and
        have ever held a good opinion of the son.
        But unhappily, Sir William, in these times a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
        man knows not where to look for backsliding;
        ’tis on every side, and the younger men are
        brought into temptation more easily.”</p>

    <p>“I find it hard to believe so much ill of my
        Lord Raby,” Carew said stoutly; “he hath
        ever borne the character of an honest man. I
        pray you, sir, to allow him full opportunity to
        clear himself of this foul charge.”</p>

    <p>“Sir,” answered Cromwell, “every subject
        of the king hath justice. Look you, Carew, I
        have no wish to cut off this man’s liberty. It
        is my unpleasant duty to stand for the king in
        these matters, and the odium of it lies on me.
        No man grieved more deeply than I for the
        loss of More, yet More’s death is charged to
        me. ’Tis like the outcry against the king’s
        lawyer, Dr. Rich, because he went to Kimbolton
        in the matter of the will of the princess
        dowager. The papists claim that her property
        was not respected. Yet the truth is plain as
        daylight. The Lady Catherine claimed to be
        the king’s wife and left no will save in the
        form of a petition to his grace; and dying as
        she did, in law, a sole woman, the administration
        of her estate lapsed to the next of kin, the
        emperor. But for the work of the attorney-general,
        the king could not have fulfilled her
        bequests. Yet Rich and I were pilloried for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
        the matter, which was but a woman’s obstinacy
        and the plain course of the law. Every rogue
        who goes to prison, every gentleman who is
        sent to the Tower, raises the hue and cry
        against me as the root of evil. ’Twould
        pleasure me far more to set them all free, but,
        unhappily, the safety of the realm forces me to
        a different course. As for Raby, I found upon
        his person papers more full of treason than an
        egg of meat. A lamb he may be, but, verily,
        he seemeth a wolf.”</p>

    <p>“He is innocent!” cried Betty, unable to
        keep silence longer; “give him but the opportunity
        to prove it.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell glanced in surprise at the animated
        and beautiful face as she stood before
        him, one hand pressed against her heart and
        the other outstretched, as if imploring mercy.</p>

    <p>“What wench have you here, Carew?” he
        asked; “such eyes should plead a cause if
        there were not such lips to enforce it.”</p>

    <p>“My niece, my lord,” said Carew, hastily
        laying a restraining hand on Betty; “a silly
        fool, who knows not enough to hold her tongue
        before her betters.”</p>

    <p>“I cannot sit by and hear an innocent man
        accused and not defend him!” exclaimed Betty,
        with all her natural impatience.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>Cromwell smiled grimly. “This nobleman
        hath truly won an advocate,” he remarked; “I
        take it that the young lady hath more than a
        common interest in him.”</p>

    <p>“They were but lately affianced,” said Sir
        William shortly, his cheek flushing, “but that
        will be soon broken if he proves the traitor.”</p>

    <p>“I am sorry, fair mistress, to lose you a
        lover,” Cromwell said, looking with some
        admiration and much kindness at the passionate
        distress on Betty’s face, “but the service
        of the king’s grace should be nearer your
        heart than this young nobleman.”</p>

    <p>“My lord,” said Betty bravely, her face
        flushed and her eyes shining, “you have been
        misled by circumstances; you do Lord Raby
        an injustice. I know that he is guiltless; I
        pledge my faith upon it!”</p>

    <p>“I doubt not your faith in him, my mistress,”
        Cromwell answered dryly, “but, unhappily,
        he gave me the packet which revealed the
        most damnable plot that it hath been my
        misfortune to behold.”</p>

    <p>“Would he have given it, my lord, had he
        been guilty?” exclaimed Raby’s defender,
        valiantly; “surely that alone declares his
        innocence.”</p>

    <p>My lord privy seal shook his head.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“’Twas but a mistake,” he said; “doubtless
        he meant to give me another. What was it
        you said of papers, Carew?”</p>

    <p>“I had intrusted some documents full of
        reports of matters in Devon, which you had
        requested, to Lord Raby’s keeping,” Sir William
        answered; “he was to deliver them to
        you, but I fear they went astray.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell looked thoughtfully from the
        window.</p>

    <p>“’Tis strange,” he said; “there were no
        such matters on his person. If I told you what
        he bore, ’twould amaze you. I fear that there
        is no clear excuse; though, in the interest of
        this young lady, I would rejoice could one be
        found.”</p>

    <p>“My lord, it shall be!” said Betty, firmly.
        “I pray you only give me time; let me see my
        Lord Raby in the Tower, and I will unravel
        this mystery.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell glanced from her impassioned face
        to Sir William’s. Woman’s devotion was an
        old story to him, from the faithful love of
        Margaret Roper to the loyalty of Mary Wyatt.
        There was something in the spectacle that
        depressed him.</p>

    <p>“The charge against Raby is of the most
        serious nature, mistress,” he said, “but I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
        give him all the time I can, albeit the king’s
        service must not suffer therefrom. Nor will I
        refuse to let you carry him what comfort you
        may, but ’tis a sorry errand for one so young,
        so beautiful, and so brave. I wish your heart
        were more happily placed.”</p>

    <p>“My lord,” said Betty, gravely, “love is
        nothing worth that may not bear misfortune.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell gave her an earnest look. It may
        be that his own thoughts went back to the
        dying Wolsey, and he knew that he had not
        failed to fight the last gallant fight for the
        fallen cardinal.</p>

    <p>“That is true enough, fair mistress,” he
        said kindly; “I do think that Raby hath at
        least a greater happiness in the Tower than
        some true men who go free. Carew, I will
        give a warrant for you and this brave wench
        to visit the prisoner, and I speak sooth when I
        say that I would gladly see the matter righted.”</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he wrote a formal warrant
        addressed to the Lieutenant of the Tower,
        admitting Sir William and his niece to visit
        a state prisoner. He handed it to Betty.</p>

    <p>“There, mistress,” he said, “I had not the
        heart to refuse thee;” and then, after another
        look at her, “I know that face surely; thou
        hast been at court?”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“’Tis the wench you sent to Kimbolton,
        my lord,” Carew said, “and lately she attended
        Queen Anne Boleyn.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell leaned back in his chair, shading
        his face with his hand.</p>

    <p>“I meant not to give the wench two such
        sad appointments,” he said gravely. “I do
        not care to think of the past in either case.
        Happily, the king is well married and if there
        be but a boy!”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” assented Carew, heartily, “’tis the
        wish of all true Englishmen.”</p>

    <p>“Sir,” said Cromwell, solemnly, “God only
        knows what it would mean to this realm. Parliament
        hath happily placed the crown at the
        disposal of the king’s grace, but to have the
        succession established would mean England’s
        salvation; and all these conspiracies which
        bring us such misery would be harmless as a
        still-born babe.”</p>

    <p>He paused; his face deeply overcast. Then
        recollecting himself, as he encountered Betty’s
        inquiring gaze, he summoned an attendant.</p>

    <p>“This man will go with you,” he said to
        Sir William, “and will secure you immediate
        admittance at the Tower.”</p>

    <p>Carew thanked him heartily, although he
        half suspected the attendant of being a spy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
        but he had no choice but to accept him. After
        a few more words, Cromwell dismissed them
        and they set out without delay for the Tower.</p>

    <p>Sir William was not altogether pleased at
        being pushed forward upon the errand, but he
        was too kind-hearted to blame his niece, who
        was so deeply distressed already. So he made
        the best of an unpleasant business and walked
        briskly to the wharf, where Cromwell’s servant
        obtained a wherry with a readiness that increased
        Sir William’s uneasiness. However, it seemed
        but an ordinary river craft, manned by four
        stout oarsmen, who haggled, as usual, over the
        fare. But Carew was so liberally inclined that
        in a few moments the bargain was completed
        and the three set out on their voyage. Betty’s
        face was muffled, and she sat quietly by her
        uncle as the boat travelled swiftly over the
        waters. They crossed that part of the river
        which was most thickly crowded with shipping,
        but the young girl had no eyes save for the low
        dark walls of the Tower, which presently came
        in sight. She shuddered when the boatmen,
        obeying the directions of Cromwell’s servant,
        turned under the dusky bastion to the Traitor’s
        Gate. The tide was rising and bore the
        wherry under the low arch to the stone steps,
        where the water lapped gently as it rose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
        Above them the arch was closed by a wicket of
        heavy wooden cross-bars, and behind this rose
        the causeway leading to the prison. On the
        other side of the wicket could be seen the
        sentries on guard. This was the view before
        them; behind, looking back through the arch,
        was the sunshine on the river, the gay life of
        the world. Here, but a short while before,
        had entered More and Fisher, the Charterhouse
        monks, and the unhappy Queen of England—a
        strange company!</p>

    <p>Sir William and Mistress Betty alighted on
        the stone steps, and the wicket was promptly
        opened at the warrant of the privy seal, which
        also ensured the visitors a respectful welcome.
        Without more delay than naturally accompanied
        the formalities of a military prison, they were
        shown into the presence of Sir William Kingston,
        who received Carew with every mark of
        kindness, as an old acquaintance.</p>

    <p>“I am well pleased to see you,” he said,
        “and better pleased that you come not as a
        permanent guest.”</p>

    <p>“God forbid!” said Sir William Carew,
        bluntly; “but I come to see one of your
        guests, Kingston; my friend, Simon Raby.”</p>

    <p>The officer’s face became grave at once.</p>

    <p>“I am sorry for his case,” he said; “he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
        the last I looked for. He will be glad to
        welcome you, for he takes not kindly to
        confinement.”</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he led the way to the rooms
        near the chapel, and having a warder with him,
        soon caused a door to be unbolted and signed
        to Carew to enter.</p>

    <p>“You have the privy seal’s warrant,” he
        said, “and yonder you will find the prisoner.”</p>

    <p>After an instant’s hesitation, Sir William
        pushed his niece forward and then followed her
        across the threshold. Kingston, closing the
        door, left them alone with the imprisoned
        nobleman. It was a low, dark room, so insufficiently
        lighted that at first they could not
        plainly see Lord Raby’s face as he rose at
        their entrance. A small fire took off a little of
        the chill of the place, but the atmosphere was
        unwholesomely damp. The unwonted captivity
        and the anxiety had driven all the color
        from the prisoner’s cheeks, and his expression
        was stern and sad. For an instant he did
        not recognize Carew, and then he uttered an
        exclamation of joy.</p>

    <p>“This is kind of you indeed!” he exclaimed,
        advancing, and as he did so, his eyes lighted
        on the cloaked figure beside Sir William. In
        an instant he recognized her, and regardless of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
        her uncle, he sprang forward and caught her in
        his arms.</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty’s high spirit would at other
        times have resisted her lover’s fashion of taking
        possession of her, but his situation made a
        sad difference, and she clung to him a moment,
        tears shining in her eyes, while he caressed
        her and blessed her for coming. It was Carew
        who interrupted this little drama.</p>

    <p>“Come, come,” he said with gruff kindness,
        “our time is short; and if we are to serve you,
        we must inquire into your case.”</p>

    <p>“’Tis so,” said Betty, withdrawing from
        Raby’s embrace; “you must tell us all.”</p>

    <p>Her lover drew forward the only two chairs
        the room afforded for his guests, and seating
        himself on a low stool at her feet, listened
        patiently to Sir William’s harangue.</p>

    <p>“My Lord Raby,” he said gravely, “but
        yesterday we received the tidings of your
        arrest, and came post-haste to London to my
        lord privy seal to learn what we could of the
        matter. Nor can I say that we were comforted
        thereby; the information is so strange that it
        perplexeth me marvellously. We were granted
        permit to come to the Tower by Cromwell, and
        here we be, but how we may serve you is not
        so plain to me. Doubtless, though, you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
        make some clean statement of the matter,
        albeit it seems so bewildering to others.”</p>

    <p>Sir William’s frame of mind was not easily
        mistaken and Raby’s cheek flushed at the
        doubt implied, even though he saw only faith
        and trust in the eyes of Betty Carew.</p>

    <p>“Unhappily, sir,” he said stiffly, “I can
        make no explanation; could I do so, doubtless
        I should not be in the Tower.”</p>

    <p>Carew bent his brows. “My lord privy seal
        tells me that you were chiefly condemned by
        the packet you gave him,” he said slowly;
        “therefore it would seem that you must hold
        some key to the matter. What was this packet?
        Wherefore did you give it to Cromwell?”</p>

    <p>“The packet was yours, Sir William,” Raby
        replied sharply, “therefore ’tis you who should
        unfold the story.”</p>

    <p>Carew’s face flushed red with indignation.</p>

    <p>“My Lord Raby,” he said coldly, “that is a
        child’s tale, but not for the ears of men. My
        papers were innocent of any offence to king or
        council; they pertained entirely to affairs in
        Devon, and were writ at Cromwell’s request.”</p>

    <p>“Sir,” replied the prisoner, sternly, “it hath
        been a mystery to me, and, albeit I would not
        have spoken of it, for fear of offence to you,
        now I will even speak my mind. The packet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
        that you gave me was cherished with care, and
        when I was apprehended, was yet in the breast
        of my doublet. My lord privy seal had received
        me kindly, and used me with the justice
        I had a right to expect. Being willing to
        serve you, even in my own misfortune, I handed
        your packet to him. Scarce had he opened it
        before his face changed, and after reading half
        its contents, he sent me to the Tower. Had I
        been minded to think ill of you, Sir William,
        surely I had cause enough, but I strove to
        judge the matter with charity. In return, you
        cast suspicion on my motives and charge me
        with falsehood in regard to this same evil
        packet. Sir, it tries my patience to its
        limit.”</p>

    <p>“’Tis sheer nonsense to lay the matter to
        my papers,” retorted Carew, irritably; “know
        I not what was writ there? Am I a fool? If
        all your conduct was as innocent, there is little
        doubt you would be a freeman.”</p>

    <p>“I am a prisoner,” Raby replied proudly,
        “and mayhap it pleasures you to cast aspersions
        on a man who may not defend himself,
        but ’tis unworthy of you.”</p>

    <p>At this, Betty interfered.</p>

    <p>“I pray you both to forbear,” she said, looking
        from one face to the other imploringly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
        “surely there is some terrible mistake, and do
        not make it worse by a quarrel.”</p>

    <p>Raby, seeing her distress, pressed her hand
        affectionately.</p>

    <p>“Dear heart,” he said, “I would not quarrel
        with thy uncle, but no man can endure such
        insinuations with patience. I am innocent,
        and I have no such meek spirit that I love to
        be suspected by my friends.”</p>

    <p>“I am an old man, my lord,” said Carew,
        impatiently, “and I am not over-smooth-tongued;
        I have no wish to offend your nice
        feelings, but I see a plain matter and you give
        me a foolish excuse. My packet! Why, Lord
        Raby, I would have sent this child Betty with
        it and taken no thought.”</p>

    <p>“Sir, I never accused you of malice,” Simon
        replied more calmly, “but I had the packet
        of you, I gave it to Cromwell, and I am
        here.”</p>

    <p>“Tush!” exclaimed Sir William, testily,
        “am I a fool? Do I look a dullard? Can you
        think to pass this dream off on a sane man?
        Raby, it was not my packet!”</p>

    <p>“Sir!” exclaimed the younger man, springing
        to his feet, “do you accuse me of falsehood?”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty rose and ran to her uncle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
        who was standing, his strong face working
        with anger.</p>

    <p>“Uncle,” she said, pushing him toward the
        door, her rosy palms pressed against his broad
        breast, and using all her young strength,
        “go—go to the door and wait for me. I would
        speak with him. You will only quarrel. Hush!
        hush!” she added, as she saw the angry words
        trembling on Sir William’s lips; “he is a
        prisoner; ’tis unworthy of you.”</p>

    <p>Sir William looked at the beautiful young
        face so close to his, and his heart relented.</p>

    <p>“Thou art a witch, Betty,” he said; “have
        thy will, but make the man talk sense to
        thee.”</p>

    <p>She had pushed him to the door, and would
        have thrust him out if the warder had not fastened
        it from without. Having disposed of
        one, she ran back to the other disputant, who
        stood leaning on his chair with a gloomy face.</p>

    <p>“Have you also so poor an opinion of me?”
        he asked, looking searchingly at the fair face.</p>

    <p>“Would I be here?” she answered simply.
        “Ah, my lord, a woman comes not lightly to
        such a place!”</p>

    <p>“Forgive me!” he exclaimed, kissing her
        hands passionately; “Sir William’s suspicions
        of me struck a sore heart. My darling, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
        I have your confidence, no man shall dare to
        doubt me.”</p>

    <p>“Think, think!” she cried, pressing her
        hand on his arm earnestly; “how did it happen?
        What can we do to explain it away?”</p>

    <p>Lord Raby shook his head; he knew too
        well the secret nature of such charges, the
        slow course of the law, the difficulty of
        defence.</p>

    <p>“I know not,” he answered, looking fondly
        into her troubled eyes; “we must even let the
        law find its own way. The attack on me is of
        a nature which I can least easily defeat. I
        trust most in mine innocence. Let it not so
        distress you, happy as it makes me to feel you
        care. Ah, Betty, I had no thought of such a
        fate when I asked you to be my wife; will you
        keep faith? Forgive me; I ought not to ask
        you to remain plighted to a prisoner.”</p>

    <p>He was looking sadly at the beautiful, animated
        face. She raised her head proudly; her
        eyes shone.</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she said sweetly, “I will wed you or
        none!”</p>

    <p>“God bless you!” he cried, catching her in
        his arms and kissing her; “I have no right to
        ask such a pledge of you!”</p>

    <p>“You asked not,” she said archly; “I gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
        it. Hark! there comes the warder; doubtless
        our time is expired. I pray you think better
        of my uncle; I love him. He is a blunt man
        and too free-spoken, but he is true as steel.”</p>

    <p>“Dear Betty,” the prisoner whispered fondly,
        “if he were a monster, I would try to love him
        for your sake.”</p>

    <p>“Come, niece!” called Sir William, impatiently,
        “we must be gone; the warder is
        here.”</p>

    <p>“I must go,” Betty said, tearing herself
        away from her lover’s detaining arms; “I must
        go, but surely will I work for your deliverance
        with all my might, and so shall my uncle.
        Farewell—oh, farewell till we meet again!”</p>

    <p>Her eyes were shining now with tears, and
        there was a third summons from Sir William
        before she parted from the prisoner, and ran
        from the room, drawing her mantle over her
        face.</p>

    <p>When they sat again in the boat, Carew
        turned to her with a grim face, but there was
        a kind light in his eyes.</p>

    <p>“My wench,” he said bluntly, “thou art a
        fool, but I love thee.”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

            <small>A SEASON OF WAITING</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Lord Raby</span> was arrested in June, and at
        the time there seemed to be an immediate
        prospect of a trial, and he looked forward to it
        with the earnest hope of establishing his innocence.
        But he was doomed to a far different
        fate; he and his fellow prisoner, the wizard,
        were held while Cromwell slowly unravelled
        the threads of a great conspiracy, which had
        been only partially indicated by the papers
        in the mysterious packet. It was not good
        policy to seize at once upon men whose names
        figured in the documents, some of them the
        foremost in the land, and the privy seal
        played the waiting game, in which he was
        an adept. The slow months of the summer
        passed, and with Michaelmas came the rising
        in the northern counties, ostensibly provoked
        by the visitation of the monasteries, but
        really the outgrowth of many grievances, and
        the full fruit of a long-planned conspiracy.
        The Pilgrimage of Grace doomed Lord Raby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
        to a long confinement. With this example of
        the result of treasonable machinations before
        his eyes, Cromwell had less mercy for those
        accused of direct complicity in it. As the
        rebels, under Robert Aske, advanced to Doncaster,
        threatening to overwhelm the king’s
        small army, the prisoners in the Tower were
        subjected to closer confinement. One of the
        avowed purposes of the insurgents was the fall
        of Cromwell, and it was not probable that he
        would be lenient to such offenders as were
        within his reach. It was, however, an inconvenient
        time for trial of the prisoners, and Raby
        and Sanders remained in suspense.</p>

    <p>Sir William Carew could not forgive the
        doubt of his packet expressed by Simon, and
        he turned a deaf ear to Betty’s entreaties. He
        would not move a finger in the cause. In fact,
        the stout-hearted gentleman doubted Lord
        Raby. The evidence was so plain, as Cromwell
        unfolded it, Simon’s accusation of Sir
        William’s documents so childish, the outbreak
        of the insurrection so convincing, that Carew
        felt certain that the nobleman had been led
        into dabbling with conspiracy and had committed
        himself to the cause of Mary Tudor and
        the papists.</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty, indignant at her uncle, distressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
        for Lord Raby, and helpless to combat
        the course of events, remained with Lady
        Crabtree. She was unable even to see the
        king in regard to the matter. Having been
        one of Anne Boleyn’s maids, she was unacceptable
        to Queen Jane, and her petitions to
        the king remained unanswered. She lived in
        seclusion at Wildrick, having no heart for the
        festivities at Hampton Court, where Jane held
        her court, and being unwelcome, she stayed
        away. She could not even obtain leave to see
        her lover; after the outbreak of the rebellion,
        she was denied access to him; he was kept in
        solitary confinement and under rigorous military
        discipline. The suspense told on the
        young girl’s nerves, and before winter was
        over she was pale and thin; but her eyes
        gained in beauty as her color faded, and her
        striking face drew many a glance of admiration
        when she went upon her pilgrimages to
        Cromwell’s house. Lady Crabtree, though
        sharing some of Carew’s doubts of Raby’s
        innocence, had a warm regard for him, and
        was ever Mistress Betty’s companion, her
        untiring energy accomplishing as much as the
        young girl’s devotion. The two figures, so
        strangely contrasted,—the gaunt old woman,
        with her long stride, and the graceful girl,—were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
        familiar in Cromwell’s anterooms, but
        their efforts to win better treatment or an open
        trial for Lord Raby were alike in vain. The
        privy seal, conscious that in the magician he
        had a master traitor, saw in Raby a probable
        accomplice. There was one also, always about
        Cromwell, whose offices boded ill for Simon.
        Sir Barton Henge was active in working for
        the government, tireless upon the scent of
        traitors, a conspicuously zealous loyalist. Yet,
        though he and the two women, old Madam and
        Betty, travelled often upon the same errand,
        they never met. The sting of Mistress Carew’s
        whip was still upon his face although the mark
        had faded, and he watched his opportunity
        with that feline patience which belongs to the
        panther tribe, whether walking on two legs or
        four, for the kinship to the beast is strong in
        some human beings.</p>

    <p>There were many anxious hearts in England
        through that long year of trouble, and the
        enemies of the king rejoiced. On Christmas
        Eve, at the great mass at St. Peter’s, the darkness
        of the church was illumined by a thousand
        tapers, while the marvellous cap and sword
        were laid upon the altar, consecrated for James
        of Scotland to unite the enemies of the faith.
        And in Flanders, Cardinal Pole looked eagerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
        for the opportunity to overthrow Henry VIII.,
        and for the return of the supremacy of Rome.
        Across the Channel, plot and counter-plot were
        hatched, took their course, and died fruitless;
        while in England, the one man with an iron
        will, the privy seal, held on his even course,
        though the waves of popular fury, beating on
        the ship of state, threatened to overwhelm the
        pilot. Norfolk, whose heart was doubtless
        more with the rebels than with the king, was
        driven against them. The unhappy Northumberland
        died faithful to Henry, although the
        fate of Anne Boleyn had prostrated him. The
        great rebellion spent itself; one after another
        of its leaders were brought to the Tower.
        The unfortunate Darcy died, charging it all on
        Cromwell, and at last, in July, Robert Aske
        suffered a felon’s death. The Pilgrimage of
        Grace was over; it had ended in a futile loss
        of life to the cause of the old religion. “Twice
        the children of Israel went up against Benjamin,”
        wrote Cardinal Pole, “and twice they
        were put to confusion.”</p>

    <p>In the midst of trials and executions, Raby
        yet lingered in the Tower untried. Either
        overlooked in the great pressure of trouble, or
        held for stronger proof, he and the wizard
        languished, each in solitary confinement. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
        king’s officers had taken possession of the
        strange house on the Thames and searched it,
        finding many curious contrivances for the
        execution of the mummeries which had confused
        the imagination of the magician’s clients.
        Yet, so exuberant was the superstition of the
        times, that the exposure of paltry methods
        of deceit failed to destroy the dread of the
        small man who had held such sway there.
        Even the royal officers shrank from their duty,
        and no one occupied the house; the official
        seal was affixed to the doors and it remained
        empty. The shutters, taken down to admit
        the light for the search, remained so, and the
        windows blinked in the afternoon sun like evil
        eyes suddenly unveiled. No man ventured
        near it after sundown, and many who passed
        it, even at high noon, made the sign of the
        cross. A baleful influence seemed to issue
        from it; the vine that tried to climb up the
        door-post hung blasted in midsummer, and
        the grass did not grow, although no footsteps
        wore the ground about it. There was not an
        old wife in the neighborhood who had not a
        tale of how the wizard visited it every night,
        and how the smoke came from the chimney of
        his laboratory at the very hour when he had
        been in the habit of brewing the devil’s tea.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Summer passed; Michaelmas came and went;
        all England waited in hope and fear for news
        of the birth of an heir to the throne, and on
        the twelfth of October, the vigil of Saint
        Edward’s day, the bells rang out in wild peals
        of joy, the bonfires blazed from Land’s End
        to the Tweed, the guns were fired. A prince
        was born; the hope of England lived.</p>

            <small>A PRINCE’S BAPTISM</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the hour appointed for the prince’s
        baptism. It was night at Hampton Court;
        the king’s equerries ran to and fro, the ladies
        of the queen were crowding the anterooms of
        the royal chamber. They had made elaborate
        toilets for the great occasion, and farthingales
        of satin and brocade spread wide on every
        hand; and more than one slender waist was
        girdled with costly pearls, while the great
        headdresses loomed up above fair faces, flushed
        and agitated with the haste and the unusual
        presence of the king; for Henry sat beside the
        state couch on which lay the young mother of
        England’s future king. Pages quarrelled over
        comfits on the staircases; gentlemen-in-waiting
        ran against each other in their eagerness to
        excel in service at that hour; the doctors and
        nurses forgot the queen in their zeal for the
        prince. The heralds, armed with silver
        trumpets, stood waiting to proclaim the glad
        event; the sponsors were come, laden with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
        gifts, the Archbishop Cranmer, the Princess
        Mary, the Duke of Norfolk—a strange company.
        My lord of Canterbury’s spoons and
        Mary Tudor’s golden cup stood side by side;
        the day was not yet ripe when she would sign
        the warrant to send the archbishop to the
        flames of martyrdom.</p>

    <p>Into this scene of confusion came my Lady
        Crabtree and Mistress Betty Carew. It was
        an hour when all guests were welcome, and
        the opportunity to reach the royal presence
        was too valuable to be lost. Betty came with
        a secret hope; she did not speak of it even to
        her companion, but it was in her heart. She
        had arrayed herself with more than usual care,
        and she looked like a stately white rose as she
        stood in the chapel waiting for the entrance of
        the great procession. Her gown was of pure
        white brocade, and on her head was the five-pointed
        hood of white velvet, such as Anne
        Boleyn had often worn; around her throat was
        a single string of pearls. Months of anxiety
        had stolen the color from her cheeks, but her
        brown eyes were larger and more lustrous, and
        there was a purpose, a resolution in her face
        which made it beautiful in its intense animation.
        Old Madam, in a singularly ugly garment
        of copper-colored satin with a marvellous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
        headdress of black velvet, made a strange foil
        for the beauty, and many a curious glance was
        cast in their direction as they stood aside,
        watching, but taking no part in the festivities.</p>

    <p>The torches flared in the royal chapel, the
        light shining red on the altar and on the solid
        silver font, which was guarded by four gentlemen,
        one of these Sir Francis Bryan, the
        cousin of Anne Boleyn. These four grand
        personages wore aprons, and towels were tied
        around their necks. There were Bryan, Sir
        John Russel, Sir Nicholas Carew, the master
        of horse, who was to lose his head in the matter
        of the Marquis of Exeter, and Sir Anthony
        Browne. The silver trumpets blew in the
        very chamber where Jane Seymour lay, and the
        procession came up between the torches to
        the silver font. There was the glitter of gold,
        the flash of jewels, the sheen of satin. Noble
        lords, great ladies, the peers of England
        walked in solemn company. The smoke from
        the many torches floated up to the roof and
        hung like a veil; below, the blaze of splendor
        dazzled the eye. Under a glittering canopy
        came the prince of England, borne in the arms
        of the Marchioness of Exeter, and behind
        walked the humble Mother Jack, the prince’s
        nurse. The Princess Mary and the Duke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
        Norfolk, Seymour, the queen’s brother, bearing
        in his arms the little Princess Elizabeth,
        who held in her hands a chrisom, her gift to
        her infant brother. The father of Anne Boleyn,
        the Earl of Wiltshire, came with a towel about
        his neck and bearing a taper of virgin wax.
        Behind these, the lords and ladies of the
        court; a long and goodly procession, sweeping
        into the chapel and filling it with a gorgeous
        display of costly silks and jewels. And the
        music of the silver trumpets filled the air,
        while on every side beauty and magnificence
        vied with each other, and the blaze of many
        torches made the chapel light as day. The
        solemn service over, his serene highness,
        Prince Edward, Duke of Cornwall and Earl of
        Chester, was proclaimed by Garter, and the
        glittering procession took its way back to the
        chamber of the queen, where King Henry had
        remained all the while. It was midnight
        when, with the music of many trumpets, the
        throng came in to the great apartment where
        the pale-faced queen lay on a state bed with a
        canopy above it, resplendent with cloth of gold.
        There was the rustle of many sweeping skirts,
        the jingle of swords and chains, the flare of
        many lights, and all the room full of faces,
        looking eagerly toward the royal couch. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
        Marchioness of Exeter bore the little prince to
        receive his mother’s blessing; the king stood
        up, looking on, boisterous in his joy. Behind
        him were the pale, gentle face of Cranmer,
        the stalwart form of Norfolk, the sad and cold-looking
        Princess Mary, the daughter of Catherine
        of Arragon, and the little golden-haired
        Elizabeth, the child of such bright hopes, and
        now stamped with the mark of illegitimacy
        and shadowed by the fearful death of Anne
        Boleyn. The little princess, though only four
        years old, had a train borne by Lady Herbert
        as she walked into the room. The king had
        increased in corpulence, and the ulcers on his
        legs made his movements painful, but he was
        very merry.</p>

    <p>“Sweetheart,” he said to the queen as she
        kissed the child, after giving it her blessing,
        “the boy hath thine eyes and will have thy
        beauty.”</p>

    <p>“My lord,” replied Jane, meekly, “I would
        rather that he looked like your grace.”</p>

    <p>“Nay,” said the king, laughing, “I am willing
        that my successor should excel me in
        looks. What say you, my lords and ladies, is
        he not a goodly boy?”</p>

    <p>There was a chorus of assent; it would have
        been a strange time to criticise the Prince of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
        England. Only one or two of the older
        women looked anxiously at the pale face and
        shining eyes of the queen, and nodded their
        heads at each other. Henry, overflowing with
        joy at the birth of a boy, moved about among
        the nobles present, talking freely to all, and
        with little thought of the nervous strain upon
        the young mother. His face softened by his
        happiness and his rich dress becoming his
        large and stately figure, the king recalled to
        many the handsome presence of his earlier
        manhood. He came down the long room,
        speaking familiarly and kindly to all whom he
        recognized, and showing his wonderful memory
        for small matters by his words to each one.</p>

    <p>“Ah, John,” he said to one tall nobleman,
        “how is that lame boy of yours? I will send
        my physician to look at his leg; the prince
        must have sound subjects.”</p>

    <p>Without waiting for thanks, he turned to
        another.</p>

    <p>“Lady Harriet, you and I grow old; we are
        both limping; but we must mend our paces
        now.” And to a younger matron, “Alice, I
        hear thy baby is a beauty; we must see if it
        can match mine.”</p>

    <p>A little farther on, he stopped beside a
        young couple who were standing together. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
        have heard of your parents’ opposition,” he
        said with boisterous kindness; “I will see to
        it that it is ended; we must have a merry wedding
        before Christmas. Trouble ceased at this
        court when the prince was born!”</p>

    <p>In his genial progress he had reached the
        end of the room where stood Betty Carew.
        Her tall, white figure and beautiful, sad face
        arrested his attention at once. It may be that
        he remembered her as an attendant of Queen
        Anne, for his own face clouded slightly and he
        looked at her with manifest interest. It was
        the opportunity for which Betty had waited,
        and she advanced with a beating heart. Her
        great beauty and something in her manner
        made a little stir as she came forward. A
        page was holding a torch near where the king
        stood, and the boy, attracted by her beauty,
        held his light so that the full radiance fell on
        her figure, outlining it in the white glistening
        folds of satin draperies and casting a wonderful
        glow in her eyes. She came forward with
        perfect dignity, pausing a little way from the
        king, her beauty causing a whisper of amazement
        to run around the circle. Henry, who
        was ever quick to recognize loveliness in
        woman, looked at her with evident admiration.</p>

    <p>“’Tis Mistress Carew, and I mistake not,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
        he said graciously. “What will you ask of
        me to-night?”</p>

    <p>“Your grace,” she replied gently, “I have
        a petition, albeit a strange one for so joyous
        an occasion, yet I pray you hear it in the name
        of Prince Edward.”</p>

    <p>“My girl, thou hast used an appeal to which
        we may not turn a deaf ear,” said Henry; “say
        on.”</p>

    <p>Mistress Betty drew a long breath; she was
        summoning all her strength to plead her
        cause.</p>

    <p>“Sire,” she said, “there is a prisoner in the
        Tower wrongfully charged with treason; an
        innocent man whom some enemy hath entangled.
        I pray your grace to hear his cause,
        to end this great suspense. Long, long he
        hath languished a prisoner without the opportunity
        to establish his innocence. And he is
        innocent!” she clasped her hands together
        with a passionate gesture, “Simon Raby is
        innocent!” she cried; “and oh, my lord the
        king, I pray you to think of the terrible strain
        of this long suspense!”</p>

    <p>“Simon Raby?” repeated the king; “once
        my equerry, I think.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, your grace,” replied the Duke of
        Norfolk, “the son of old Lord Raby of Sussex;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
        an honest gentleman, who died nearly two
        years ago.”</p>

    <p>“An honest gentleman; ay, I remember
        him; he served my father well,” said the king,
        thoughtfully. “Cromwell hath been eager
        trapping his mice, but I would not keep a true
        man in jail. Hath he not been tried, Mistress
        Carew?” he added, looking again at Betty.</p>

    <p>“Nay, your highness,” she replied sadly;
        “he has languished long, and with no hope,
        nor have they let his friends see him.”</p>

    <p>“How long hath he been in the Tower?”
        asked Henry, gravely.</p>

    <p>“Fourteen months and more, Sire,” she
        answered.</p>

    <p>“’Tis too long,” said the king, frowning.
        “I have no will to keep a poor gentleman without
        a trial; this shall be looked into.”</p>

    <p>Betty’s heart beat high with hope, but she
        had yet a petition to make, and Henry saw it
        in her expression. Her beauty, her evident
        loyalty to the prisoner interested him.</p>

    <p>“Speak, sweetheart,” he said kindly; “what
        is in thy mind?”</p>

    <p>“I pray your grace to give me warrant to
        see the wizard, Zachary Sanders, who is also
        in the Tower,” she said; “they let no man see
        him, but I know that if he will, he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
        surely clear Lord Raby; and oh, I beseech your
        highness, to let me plead with him!”</p>

    <p>Henry smiled. “You are not like to plead
        in vain, fair mistress,” he said lightly; “for
        the sake of this blessed night, your petitions
        are both granted. Norfolk, bid my lord privy
        seal to give this pretty beggar a warrant to go
        into the Tower. But hark you, my wench, I
        charge you not to leave your heart behind you
        there,” and with a laugh at his own jest, the
        king passed on, surrounded by an ever-increasing
        throng of courtiers until the apartment of
        the queen was gradually deserted, save by her
        own attendants.</p>

    <p>The first white streaks of dawn were showing
        at the eastern horizon when Lady Crabtree
        and Betty left Hampton Court, and the mists
        of night obscured the scene.</p>

    <p>“Thou didst have rare luck, my girl,” said
        old Madam, drawing her mantle closer in the
        chill air; “and now there is a hope to end the
        matter.”</p>

    <p>“The king’s grace was kind,” replied Betty,
        “and I have good hope, for I believe that now
        they will hear Simon’s cause; and if they do,
        all will be well.”</p>

    <p>“Mayhap it will,” retorted Lady Crabtree
        dryly, unwilling to cast down the young girl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
        new-born hopes; “at least, Cromwell shall do
        more than shake his head at us. ’Tis well
        that you struck while the iron was hot and the
        king was happy; for if they keep up that rout,
        they will kill both mother and child. Mercy
        on us, what a baptism! My lord of Canterbury
        and Mary Tudor walking together, and Norfolk,
        who loves the papists with all his heart.
        That ambitious prig, too, my Lord Seymour,
        who will rise on his sister’s petticoats. It
        went to my heart to see Anne Boleyn’s baby
        decked out to march behind this new toy!
        Well-a-day, ’tis strange!”</p>

    <p>A little farther on, she burst out laughing;
        a scornful laugh, too, which startled Betty.</p>

    <p>“What makes you so merry, madam?” she
        asked quietly.</p>

    <p>“Saw you not that fool, the Earl of Wiltshire,”
        old Madam asked, “with a towel tied
        around his neck, and carrying my Lord Cranmer’s
        silver pots, the christening present?
        Lord! why did he not go fetch his daughter’s
        head? The drivelling idiot would dance at
        his own funeral, if he could crook his legs,
        with the hope to please the king’s grace. ’Tis
        such a courtier that upsets an honest stomach.
        Were I the king, I’d send him home with a
        merry flogging, as an ass.”</p>

            <small>THE WIZARD IN THE TOWER</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Superstition</span> works its own miracles, and
        strangely enough, even in the Tower of London,
        its spell took effect. The royal officers had
        secured the person of the wizard and had suffered
        no harm from the contact. It was true
        that one young man had fallen in a fit at some
        strange vision in the wizard’s house, but the
        others were unscathed. Yet the power of the
        little man’s strange eyes and stranger manner
        worked upon them, and no prisoner in the
        Tower was better treated or with more reverence.
        The warder locked him in with shaking
        hands, his knees knocking together, and but
        for the sharper terror of the rope at Tyburn, he
        might have failed to turn the key upon his
        captive. The sentinels within the Traitor’s
        Gate declared that at midnight the small man
        in a russet cloak passed between them, not in
        natural shape, but floating past them like a
        vapor, going through the close-barred wicket
        to the river and returning again at dawn. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
        food, the wizard had an abundance; he had but
        to express the wish for some new viand, accompanying
        it with a gruesome prophecy in regard
        to his keeper’s future, and the dish was immediately
        forthcoming. They denied him nothing;
        when other prisoners shivered, he had a fire;
        when better men languished in the dark, he
        had twenty tall tapers burning around his
        room. He was freely supplied with pen and
        paper, and he filled the sheets with cabalistic
        signs which froze the blood of his attendants.
        One of the bolder warders refused to tend his
        fire for him; the wizard looked up with a
        strange face and passed his hands before his
        eyes.</p>

    <p>“Thy wife has a fit,” he said calmly; “the
        baby is born dead.”</p>

    <p>The man hurried from the room, grumbling
        at the prisoner as an evil croaker, and at the
        door he heard the news confirmed. After that
        he almost grovelled in his anxiety to serve the
        evil little man who only laughed and mocked
        his terror. Nothing but a wholesome fear of
        Cromwell’s anger kept such a prisoner in the
        Tower; a thousand times he could have escaped,
        but that, at the last moment, the thought of
        the privy seal stayed the hands of his would-be
        liberators. Cromwell could not be trifled with;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
        his arm was long, his vengeance swift, his
        eye that of a hawk looking for prey. Between
        the two, the magician and the king’s minister,
        the warders of the Tower lived as men do
        between the devil and the deep sea.</p>

    <p>It was the day after Prince Edward’s great
        christening, and the wizard sat in his prison
        watching the blaze leap from the logs piled in
        his chimney. The wind was chill without, but
        he was warm, thanks to the terror of his
        jailers. He sat on a low stool, his elbows on
        his knees, his chin in his hands, gazing at the
        flames as if he loved them; the red glow of the
        fire flaring on his wizened face and in his wonderful
        eyes. He was dressed in russet-colored
        damask, a cape of Flanders lace about his
        neck, and on his head a pointed scarlet cap
        with an opal in the front, clasping the one stiff
        feather. He wore velvet shoes, scarlet like
        his cap, and on his thin, long-fingered hands
        were some curious rings, all strangely wrought
        and fantastic in design. He had but recently
        stirred the fire, and the blaze leaped up the
        chimney with a merry roar and crackle. So
        intent was he in his study of it that he never
        turned his head when the warder opened his
        door and admitted two closely muffled women.
        The visitors came in a little way and stopped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
        looking at him without speaking, while the
        warder, after staring in with wide-mouthed
        curiosity, retreated in fear of provoking the
        wizard’s displeasure. When he had closed the
        door, the scene remained for some moments
        unchanged; the two women standing together,
        evidently watching the magician, though their
        mantles concealed their faces, and he still gazing
        fixedly at the blaze as if he read some story
        in it. There was no sound but the sharp
        crackle of the wood, and there was something
        unpleasantly awe-inspiring in the stillness of
        the gloomy place, where no light shone but the
        red one of the flames. Presently the wizard
        broke the silence. He had not shown by any
        sign or movement that he had seen his visitors,
        but he addressed them now, though without
        turning his head or glancing in their
        direction.</p>

    <p>“My Lady Crabtree and Mistress Carew,
        you are welcome,” he said calmly; “come to
        the fire and be seated.”</p>

    <p>Old Madam laughed harshly.</p>

    <p>“What is the use to wear a mask?” she
        said; “the creature hath eyes in the back of
        his head like a spider.”</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she drew nearer the fire and
        seated herself on a settle opposite the astrologer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
        and Betty came over and stood beside her,
        looking eagerly at the weird figure before
        them.</p>

    <p>“You came from Hampton Court,” remarked
        the wizard composedly, for the first time looking
        at them attentively, “with the king’s warrant
        to visit the Tower in the matter of my
        Lord Raby.”</p>

    <p>“We came to see you, sir,” Betty said earnestly,
        “to learn the truth. We are convinced
        that you can clear him if you will.
        In common charity, I pray you, help us untangle
        this conspiracy against an innocent
        man.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, I know the truth,” retorted the magician;
        “’tis my business; but why should I
        make my Lord Raby’s affairs mine?”</p>

    <p>“Tush, Sanders!” exclaimed Lady Crabtree,
        who was unmoved by any awe of him, “do not
        play the innocent. We all know that you are
        knee-deep and elbow-deep in this conspiracy
        and like to hang at Tyburn.”</p>

    <p>“Nay, I will never hang,” replied the wizard
        coldly, fixing his large and marvellously radiant
        eyes upon her, “nor will the prince baptized
        last night live to manhood.”</p>

    <p>“Pshaw!” said Lady Crabtree, with a laugh,
        “it takes no magician to predict danger to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
        baby with the rumpus they are making over
        it; any old wife can beat you there as a
        prophet!”</p>

    <p>The strong-minded old woman had thrown
        back her wraps and sat by the fire, her hawk-like
        nose and square chin sharply outlined in
        the red light, and her great frame contrasting
        strangely with the diminutive one of the
        prisoner. The two natures, naturally defiant
        and antagonistic, recognized the qualities which
        made them so, and they eyed each other in
        mutual dislike and suspicion. But Betty
        Carew had only the one object and hope, and
        something in her beauty perhaps appealed to
        Sanders, for he treated her with more consideration
        than usual; he had, too, his own
        reasons for aiding her. She came a step nearer
        now and stood looking at him; her hood had
        fallen back and revealed her head, with its
        black hair uncovered, framing her pale but
        handsome face; her hands hung loosely clasped
        before her, and the firelight played in her
        deep brown eyes.</p>

    <p>“I pray you,” she said eagerly, “consider
        that he who so entangled Raby by placing that
        packet on his person,—in some marvellous
        manner,—he also must have betrayed you.
        Your cause is therefore identical with ours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
        Surely you can think of some one who had
        the means to compass this—and the will.”</p>

    <p>The wizard looked at her thoughtfully; not
        a change of expression denoted that he felt any
        interest in what she said.</p>

    <p>“Lord Raby had a servant,” he replied,
        deliberately stirring the fire; “he can tell you
        all you wish to know.”</p>

    <p>“We thought of that,” cried Betty; “but it
        is judged impossible that so ignorant a man
        could have had access to the papers which are
        now in the hands of Cromwell.”</p>

    <p>“Nevertheless, I tell you, find him,” returned
        the wizard, calmly.</p>

    <p>“He hath been already interrogated,” replied
        Betty, sadly, “and now we know not where he
        is—since Lord Raby dismissed him.”</p>

    <p>“He is in a house in Cheapside,” said the
        astrologer. “You may find it easily; the door
        is painted green and hath a rat-hole in the
        lower left-hand corner; there are three windows
        in the front of the house, each different
        in size and shape. He sleeps in the attic.”</p>

    <p>“He will tell us nothing,” Betty answered
        in despair; “we have tried, and my Lord Raby
        is sure he knows nothing.”</p>

    <p>The wizard laughed, not mirthfully, but as
        if he relished some grim joke.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“He is in that attic,” he said dryly; “take
        him and he will tell you all.”</p>

    <p>“I tell you,” cried Betty, with impatience,
        “he will tell us nothing.”</p>

    <p>“Singe him,” retorted the wizard, with a
        grin; “my lord privy seal can teach you how
        to entreat a prisoner to speak.”</p>

    <p>Betty recoiled with horror, but old Madam
        caught at the idea.</p>

    <p>“The man is right,” she remarked calmly;
        “’tis easy enough to screw out the truth.
        But verily, Sir Wizard, is there not more to
        tell?”</p>

    <p>The little magician shrugged his shoulders.</p>

    <p>“I have told enough,” he said; “a woman
        who is near fourscore should know the rest
        without telling.”</p>

    <p>This reference to Lady Crabtree’s age
        brought the angry blood to her face; she never
        admitted it to any one, and to find that this
        strange creature knew it, moved her to wrath.
        She rose and gathered her mantle about her.</p>

    <p>“Come Betty,” she said sharply, “we but
        waste time on this fool. Let us begone.”</p>

    <p>The wizard sat laughing silently, his sinister
        face lighted up with malicious enjoyment.</p>

    <p>Betty lingered a moment, while Lady Crabtree
        hurried to the door.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Is there nothing else?” she asked earnestly;
        “no other way?”</p>

    <p>“If you follow my instructions,” replied the
        wizard, “all will be well; if not—” He
        shrugged his shoulders.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

            <small>A SNARE</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Mistress Betty</span> left the Tower with a heavy
        heart; she could not believe in the success of
        the wizard’s plans, and she had failed to see
        Lord Raby. He was that day carried before
        the Council to be examined, by order of the
        king, who had not forgotten Betty’s petition.
        Thus, while she was thankful that the long
        suspense was over, she was disappointed in
        the hope of seeing her lover, after the months
        of separation. She could but wait and hope,
        in the mean time making every effort to establish
        his innocence. Her courage and determination
        so moved old Madam to admiration
        that she lacked no aid from that quarter, and
        fortunately, for their success, they found Sir
        William Carew in London. He had come up
        from Devon two days before and was in lodgings
        on the Strand, engaged in transacting
        business with the Council. He was little
        inclined, at first, to listen to their talk of
        Lord Raby, having still his grievance in regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
        to his packet, but at the mention of Simon’s
        servant, he remembered his wager that the
        man was a rogue, and was more willing to
        undertake any matter that would prove the
        infallibility of his own judgment. He was
        not free of a superstitious awe of the wizard,
        and showed himself to be quite ready to follow
        his instructions, even without his niece’s
        entreaties.</p>

    <p>“Let be, let be,” he said, in answer to
        Betty’s suggestions; “I will take this matter
        in hand. I have two stout knaves with me,
        and they should be enough to catch the varlet.
        It shall be done secretly too, that those who
        employ him may not take warning and so
        escape us. Go to your quarters with my Lady
        Crabtree, and I will see that this business is
        executed in good time.”</p>

    <p>Betty was reluctant to leave the scene of
        action; she was eager for the first gleam of
        hope that might dawn with Shaxter’s revelations,
        if he made them.</p>

    <p>“Uncle, you will tell me what he says?”
        she asked. “I cannot endure this suspense so
        long.”</p>

    <p>“I will send for you,” Sir William answered.
        “Your presence here now is more
        hindrance than help; but trust me, wench, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
        will tell you all there is to know, if indeed
        this rogue can reveal anything of importance.”</p>

    <p>Old Madam had been below stairs talking
        with an acquaintance at the door, and she
        came up now with a face of importance.</p>

    <p>“There are bad tidings from Hampton
        Court,” she said; “the queen hath taken cold;
        was ill last night, and to-day is reported dying.
        Saint Thomas! what luck the king hath with
        his wives!”</p>

    <p>“Now may Heaven save the prince!” exclaimed
        Sir William, baring his head reverently;
        “the hope of the realm is centered in
        that child. We have scarce had time to
        express our thanksgiving for his birth, and
        cruel indeed would be the blow that took him
        from us.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” retorted Lady Crabtree; “the papists
        would have then the merry stirring that they
        have looked for these long years, and James of
        Scotland might use the nightcap that the pope
        sent him for Christmas. Happily, the queen’s
        death need not now mean the loss of the
        prince; but they do say that it is a sickly
        child, and like to be, with such a father.”</p>

    <p>“I remember the days when the king’s grace
        was the very type of English manhood,” Carew
        remarked thoughtfully, “and as gallant a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
        knight as ever wore harness; of goodly stature
        and amiable countenance, wise in council,
        learned in philosophy, and as gracious a prince
        as any man might desire.”</p>

    <p>“A wise man now, save with women,”
        replied old Madam dryly; “but carrying too
        great a load of flesh and with the disease
        settled in his legs, no longer like to be a great
        soldier, or to live long. Well, well, this is
        his third queen, and she will not be cool before
        the Council will prefer suit to his grace to take
        another.”</p>

    <p>“It may be that another woman will not
        long for such an unlucky place,” remarked
        Betty, quietly; “there seems to be death in
        it.”</p>

    <p>“Cromwell can send abroad then,” said Lady
        Crabtree; “he will even get Master Friskyball
        to help him find an Italian princess; but look
        you, my girl, the applicants here will be as
        thick as cherries. Do you know your sex so
        little as to think that they will lose the chance
        of a crown? If a man looks like a wild boar,
        he will yet find a woman to marry him; some
        fool who will imagine that his heart is not
        indicated by his snout. I tell you women are
        all fools once; more’s the pity!”</p>

    <p>She was putting on her cloak as she spoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
        and having muffled it about her, she gave some
        parting instructions to Sir William; and then
        taking Betty, went down the stairs to the door
        where her attendants waited her.</p>

    <p>“You will go to my lodgings,” she said to
        her young companion; “but I have other business,
        and it may be late this night before I
        come. Content yourself, however, with the
        recollection that I will keep Sir William
        spurred up to the pitch.”</p>

    <p>Reluctantly enough Mistress Betty resigned
        herself to the wishes of her elders, and was
        escorted to Lady Crabtree’s lodgings by one of
        her attendants. It was dusk when she passed
        through the gates, the porter closing them
        behind her. She crossed the little court, and
        entering the house, dismissed her follower and
        went alone up the stairs to the rooms where
        they were lodging. One of old Madam’s
        women was there and had made the place
        cheerful. A fire burned on the hearth, the
        tapers were lighted, and a supper was laid for
        two upon the table in the center. It was a
        fast day, and there were some salted eels, a
        gurnet and a chet loaf set out, with a tankard
        of ale; for my Lady Crabtree always did good
        trencher duty even when fasting, which she
        did after her own fashion.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>Betty Carew could not eat, she was far too anxious
        for the fate of the man she loved, and she
        walked to and fro, wrapped in her own thoughts
        and alone, having dismissed the woman. Lord
        Raby had been before the Council, but doubtless,
        by this time, was back in the Tower.
        How had it fared with him? she wondered.
        Had his innocence shone out clear as noonday,
        or had he been entrapped by the skilful cross-questioning
        and false accusations of his enemies?
        Believing in him with all her heart,
        she was yet fully conscious of the pitfalls in
        these secret proceedings, and she trembled for
        him. It was in her nature to love him more
        dearly in the hour of his evil fortune; she
        possessed that loyalty which is unshaken by
        the sharpest trials, and her greatest sorrow
        now was her own inability to fight his battles
        for him. Her persistence had won the king’s
        attention to his case, had roused even her
        uncle from his angry apathy, had stirred old
        Madam to energetic action; but now, at the
        supreme moment, being a woman, she was
        powerless to help him. She longed for Sir
        William’s summons, which would mean that
        something material had been accomplished,
        and in her eagerness, she ran twenty times to
        the window and looked down into the street; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
        light burned in the court, and this showed her
        that there was no one at the door. The time
        dragged wearily; Lady Crabtree came not, and
        there seemed little hope of any decisive action
        that night. Weary of her restless walk, she
        sat down by the fire, which was beginning to
        burn low, and waited. Every sound in the
        house, every step in the hall made her start
        with impatience; yet she scarcely knew what
        she expected. Nature has strong claims upon
        the young and healthy; no matter how great the
        anxiety, sleep comes at last, stealing over
        the senses, pressing down the lids, stilling the
        eager heart-beats. Betty had been under an
        almost continuous strain, and the warmth of the
        fire relaxed her nerves, comforted her physical
        weariness; her head drooped on her hand,
        her eyes closed, her breathing became soft and
        regular, in a few moments she would have
        drifted into unconsciousness. But suddenly
        there was a stir below, the sound of feet on the
        stairs, and Lady Crabtree’s woman came hurrying
        in. Betty started up at once, alert and
        eager.</p>

    <p>“’Tis a message from my uncle!” she
        exclaimed; “from Sir William Carew?”</p>

    <p>“Two men with a litter below, mistress,”
        the woman replied, “and a message from Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
        William that you come at once to his lodgings.”</p>

    <p>Betty’s fingers trembled with eagerness as
        she fastened her cloak with the attendant’s
        aid. Something had happened, something was
        known; she could not brook a moment’s delay.</p>

    <p>“Shall I go with you, Mistress Betty?” the
        tirewoman asked.</p>

    <p>“Nay; you must stay for Lady Crabtree,”
        Betty replied; “and tell her where I am. It
        does not matter; I can go alone with my
        uncle’s servants.”</p>

    <p>Without further delay, she ran lightly down
        the stairs, where she found two serving men
        in Sir William’s livery, and at the door a
        litter carried by four others, and there were
        two pages with lanterns. She did not recognize
        any of the men, but observed that
        one was cross-eyed, a powerful fellow, standing
        by the litter. She asked no questions,
        but sprang into her place, dropping the curtains
        to keep out the chill night air, and in
        a moment they were off upon their journey.
        Her attendants said nothing, but walked so
        rapidly along the streets that she was jolted
        from side to side; but they could not travel
        fast enough to keep pace with her eagerness.
        Twice or thrice she peeped out from behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
        her curtains, but the night was so dark that
        she could not see beyond the small circles of
        light made by the lanterns. They passed the
        watch, for she heard them answering his challenge,
        and it seemed to her that it took longer
        to reach Sir William’s lodgings than it had
        taken to come from them earlier in the evening.
        Yet no doubt crossed her feverishly
        excited brain, and she was all hope and expectation
        when at last the party halted, and the
        men helped her to alight. She had been but
        once to her uncle’s quarters, and was not sufficiently
        familiar with them to be startled when
        she found herself at the door of a tall house;
        but something in its aspect roused her first
        suspicion. Before she could realize where she
        was, the door opened, and partly because she
        was not yet aroused, and partly, too, because
        the men gathered behind her, leaving no
        retreat, she entered, and seeing a staircase like
        the one at Sir William’s lodgings, began to
        ascend. Stopping half-way, she asked the man
        who followed her, the cross-eyed escort, where
        her uncle was? He pointed to a door before
        her without speaking, and she opened it and
        walked in. It was dimly lighted, and at the
        farther end was standing a tall man with his
        back toward her.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“Uncle, I have come,” she exclaimed; “what
        tidings have you?”</p>

    <p>He turned and came slowly forward; as the
        light of the solitary taper that burned on the
        table fell on his face, she recognized Sir
        Barton Henge.</p>

            <small>MASTER CROSS-EYES</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">The</span> instant that Betty Carew recognized
        Sir Barton’s dark face, she recoiled with a cry
        of terror. Her first thought was of the door by
        which she had entered, but when she ran to it
        she found it fastened on the outside. There
        was another entrance, but that was behind
        Henge, and he stepped back, and locking it,
        put the key in his pocket with a grim smile.
        She was a prisoner; but after the first moment
        of dismay, she collected herself and confronted
        him with spirit. She was angry at his insolent
        daring, and her cheeks flushed and her
        eyes sparkled.</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she said proudly, “what means this?
        How dare you so insult me? Undo the door
        and let me go or you will answer for it to my
        uncle!”</p>

    <p>Henge laughed and sneered.</p>

    <p>“You take a high tone, mistress,” he said
        tauntingly, “but it will be long ere Carew
        finds you; you are safe enough at last!”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>Betty’s anger for the time conquered her
        womanly fears; her hatred of the man, her
        contempt for an act that seemed to her one of
        cowardly wickedness, made her forgetful of
        her peril.</p>

    <p>“You villain!” she cried, her form quivering
        with passion, “have you no better employment
        than to make war on a defenceless
        woman? It is like you! He who would strike
        a man from ambush is capable of any shamelessness.
        Undo the door, sir, or I will call
        the watch and make your name a byword in
        London!”</p>

    <p>“Scream your loudest; it will not aid you,”
        he retorted coolly. “Come, come, my pretty
        shrew; I have you now, and you shall rue the
        day you struck my face with your whip.”</p>

    <p>In spite of her anger, a feeling of dismay
        was beginning to shake Mistress Betty’s resolution.
        She remembered that there was a
        little dagger in her belt that she had thrust
        there in the morning when she set out to the
        Tower. The thought of it was some small
        comfort; she had, at least, a weapon. She
        would not let him see any wavering; she held
        her head high and faced him like a beautiful
        fury.</p>

    <p>“If you dare to harm me,” she said haughtily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
        “Sir William Carew will leave no stone unturned
        until you are brought to justice.”</p>

    <p>Henge laughed again his unpleasant laugh,
        that rang in her ears with the sound of triumph
        in it.</p>

    <p>“Look you, fair mistress, is it well to flaunt
        your influence in my face?” he asked her.
        “You and your precious lover defied me.
        Where is Simon Raby now? Safe, where he
        can neither save you nor himself. A traitor
        in the Tower! Beware, lest Carew falls in a
        like trap.”</p>

    <p>“Ah, now I know!” cried Betty; “a fool I
        was, and blind. ’Tis you who ensnared Lord
        Raby! ’tis you who would ruin my uncle.
        Villain! liar! coward! I defy you!”</p>

    <p>“You young she-devil, you!” exclaimed
        Henge, advancing toward her, “I would wring
        that white neck of yours for your insults, did
        I not know I could invent a slower, surer
        punishment. I have you, my shrew, and you
        shall not escape me.”</p>

    <p>At his first step toward her, Betty retreated
        to a window, and now she tried to unfasten the
        shutter, crying out for help at the top of her
        strong, young voice.</p>

    <p>“Scream away!” said Henge bitterly, his
        face full of dark enjoyment of her despair, “no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
        one will help you; a screaming woman in this
        quarter of the town is no novelty. Do you
        look for your lover from the Tower to rescue
        you? You pretty fool!” he added contemptuously,
        “you are mine, mine as sure as death!”</p>

    <p>Betty was no coward; she put her hand to
        her girdle and felt the little knife there safe.
        She meant to kill him—or herself. She had
        a firm, strong wrist and she could strike; he
        was a powerful man, but he did not know that
        she was armed, and an unlooked-for blow might
        end the matter. She saw the evil triumph in
        his face and set her teeth; she would kill him.
        He, unconscious of her purpose, looked at her
        and smiled, as a devil might, who saw his prey
        before him.</p>

    <p>At this moment there was a strange interruption;
        the door that Henge had not fastened,
        the one that had been secured from without,
        opened, and the cross-eyed man entered, and
        closing it behind him, stood, with his arms
        folded on his breast, staring at Sir Barton, who,
        in turn, glared at him in furious surprise.</p>

    <p>“What are you here for, Master Cross-Eyes?”
        he exclaimed. “Get out, you rogue,
        or I will break a rod on your bare back and slit
        your ears, to boot.”</p>

    <p>The groom pointed at Betty.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“She screamed,” he said sullenly; “if you
        hurt a hair of her head, I’ll cut your throat,
        my master!”</p>

    <p>“You accursed villain, you!” cried Henge,
        in furious anger, “how dare you threaten me?
        Is it for this that I dragged you from the
        gutter?”</p>

    <p>“Nay,” retorted Master Cross-Eyes, unmoved;
        “you picked me up from the slums
        because you wanted desperate men to do your
        bidding; and so I would, if the case were
        different, but Mistress Carew you shall not
        hurt.”</p>

    <p>So amazed was Henge at the varlet’s courage,
        that he did not spurn him from the room
        at once, but stared at him as if he doubted his
        own senses.</p>

    <p>“And wherefore?” he asked harshly; “what
        is Mistress Carew to you, you hound?”</p>

    <p>“One good turn deserves another, Sir
        Barton,” the groom answered curtly; “this
        young mistress saved my neck from the halter
        at Deptford when old Lady Crabtree would
        have hung me as a valiant beggar. The young
        lady saved me, and, by Saint Michael and his
        angels, you shall not harm one black hair of
        her pretty head!”</p>

    <p>“The devil take your insolence!” retorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
        Henge violently, drawing his sword and raising
        his arm to strike the man on the head with
        the flat of it, intending to administer a lesson.</p>

    <p>But Master Cross-Eyes was more than his
        match in strength; he caught his arm, and
        twisting it back, sent the sword flying across
        the room, pushing Henge toward the wall as
        he did so. Sir Barton, now fully roused to his
        peril, grappled with his powerful adversary,
        calling loudly for help as he did so.</p>

    <p>“What ho!” he shouted, “John! Andrew!
        Here, you villains, take this fellow to the
        gallows!”</p>

    <p>Master Cross-Eyes laughed, much as Sir
        Barton had at Betty’s cries for aid.</p>

    <p>“I sent them all below,” he said grimly;
        “you may scream as loud as my young lady
        now, and get no aid.”</p>

    <p>The two men swayed and struggled, the
        vagrant having the advantage, yet closely
        pressed by Henge, who was no mean opponent
        and had the strength of wrath. They overturned
        the table, and the taper being extinguished,
        the struggle continued in darkness.
        Sir Barton was striving to reach the door and
        Cross-Eyes was pressing him away.</p>

    <p>At first Betty was so wholly fascinated by
        the contest, so amazed, that she stood gazing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
        completely unnerved, her courage deserting
        her now that a champion was so suddenly
        raised up for her. But in a moment
        the full peril of her own situation returned to
        her mind, and she looked for a way to escape
        while the two were fighting. However, this
        was not easy; one door was still locked, and
        before the other the men were struggling; she
        could not pass them and get out, for they
        swayed to and fro before the entrance, and
        when the taper was extinguished, she could
        not see to move. In her extremity, she put
        out all her strength, and undoing the shutters
        at last, threw them open, and leaning from the
        window, screamed for the watch. In spite of
        the noise that the two men made fighting, she
        heard an answering shout, and cried out again
        that there was murder being done. As she
        did so, there was a groan of pain from Master
        Cross-Eyes and he fell heavily to the floor;
        Henge had wrenched his hand free from his
        adversary’s grip, and drawing his dagger,
        stabbed him. With an oath, Sir Barton threw
        open the door and snatched a taper from its
        socket in the hall and brought it into the room;
        the sudden light revealed to Betty the prostrate
        figure of her defender and the furious
        aspect of her enemy. He kicked the groom as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
        he passed him and then picked up his sword.
        Seeing her last hope of escape cut off, Betty
        again leaned from the window and called for
        help. This time the reply came from the court
        below, and there was a noise at the door.
        Expecting the watch, Sir Barton turned with a
        curse to confront him, his naked sword in his
        hand. The scene was one of wild confusion;
        the taper he had brought, and the light from
        the hall showed the scene of the struggle, the
        overturned table and chairs, the unconscious
        body of the vagrant, and in the window Betty’s
        tall figure and white face. Henge himself
        stood waiting defiantly, his dress wildly disordered,
        and his breast heaving from his recent
        struggle. Footsteps came up the stairs, paused
        as if a stranger were looking about for the room
        from which the screams had issued, and then
        came across the hall. The next moment a man
        stood on the threshold, and at the sight of him
        Betty uttered a wild cry of amazement and joy,
        while Henge swore a deep oath, but recoiled a
        step as if he saw a ghost.</p>

    <p>It was Simon Raby.</p>

            <small>SIR WILLIAM WINS A WAGER</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Simon Raby</span> stood only a moment on the
        threshold; a single glance at the interior of
        the room, at Betty, at Master Cross-Eyes,
        lying prostrate, and at the furious face of
        Henge, sufficed to tell him all. The next
        instant his sword flashed in the air like a
        ribbon of steel, and he sprang upon Sir Barton
        with the fury of revenge.</p>

    <p>“You villain!” he cried, “was it not enough
        to send me to the Tower, but you must also
        insult and injure women?”</p>

    <p>“Curse you!” answered Henge, between
        his teeth, “this shall be the end of you, you
        fool!”</p>

    <p>“By heaven!” exclaimed Raby, as their
        swords crossed, “’twill be either you or I!”</p>

    <p>Both were powerful men and good swordsmen,
        and it being the second time that they
        had fought, each knew something of the other’s
        play. Henge was spent from his struggle with
        the groom and Raby had felt the effects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
        the long imprisonment, but both fought with
        furious zeal, and knowing that death was in the
        issue, they put out all their skill. Foot to
        foot and eye to eye, they thrust and parried;
        Raby taking the offensive and using the point
        as he endeavored to strike under his adversary’s
        guard, but Henge was one of the finest swordsmen
        of the court and parried every blow with
        marvellous rapidity and skill. The breath of
        both came short, the drops of perspiration
        gathered on Henge’s forehead, while Lord
        Raby’s face paled about the lips. It was but
        the different way in which each showed the
        strain. So determined was Simon’s onset, that
        he drove Sir Barton back step by step toward
        the table, meaning to trip him and so have him
        at his mercy; but Henge knew the trap that
        was set for him and swerved to one side, dealing
        at the same instant so dexterous a blow
        that he nearly disarmed his opponent. There
        was no sound in the room but the clash of
        swords and the labored breathing of the two
        combatants. It was a spectacle worth seeing,
        the equal contest of two expert fencers. For a
        few moments Betty Carew had remained at her
        post by the window, so amazed at Raby’s
        entrance, so alarmed for his safety, that it
        paralyzed her senses. But at the sight of Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
        Barton’s apparent gain, she awoke from her
        trance and ran to them, throwing herself on
        Henge’s sword arm with all her strength; but
        he took his weapon in his left hand and parried
        Raby’s blows while endeavoring to shake her
        off.</p>

    <p>“Let be, my darling!” Simon cried; “I
        dare not strike freely with you in the way; let
        be—and I will end it.”</p>

    <p>But Mistress Betty would scarcely have
        obeyed him but for the sound of footsteps on
        the stairs. She ran out into the hall to learn
        whether it was friend or foe, and saw, to her
        amazement, old Madam’s hawk face upon the
        landing, and behind her the captain of the
        watch and two more armed men. Betty cried
        out with joyful surprise.</p>

    <p>“Help, help!” she exclaimed, “here is the
        villain Henge trying to murder Simon Raby.”</p>

    <p>“This all comes of Raby’s mad haste!”
        retorted Lady Crabtree; “’tis ever so with
        fools and lovers.”</p>

    <p>But while she stayed to scold, the captain
        of the watch and Betty had hurried back into
        the room. As they reached the entrance, however,
        there was a heavy fall, and they found
        Simon Raby standing with his foot on Sir
        Barton’s breast and the point of his sword at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
        his throat, while Master Cross-Eyes, who had
        recovered from his swoon, sat up, staring
        blankly at the changed scene. The captain of
        the watch uttered an exclamation and hurried
        forward.</p>

    <p>“Have you killed him, my lord?” he asked.</p>

    <p>Henge lay so still that Raby stirred him
        with his foot.</p>

    <p>“I know not,” he answered; “he has a
        thrust below the collar bone, but I think ’tis
        too high for his heart. I got a blow under his
        guard and he went down like a sack of salt,
        and has not opened his eyes since.”</p>

    <p>“’Twas a pity to kill him,” the officer said,
        laying his hand on the fallen man’s heart;
        “my lord privy seal would have him taken
        alive at all costs.”</p>

    <p>The room began to fill with strangers, twenty
        torches and lanterns were about it and on the
        stairs; the court was thronged with a gaping
        crowd that fell back to let two new-comers
        pass, Sir William Carew and Cromwell. Some
        one had run for a leech, and the little man
        came hurrying in with his bag and knelt on
        the other side of Henge, opposite the captain.
        Old Madam was there, her farthingale tucked
        up and her great boots showing, and Betty
        Carew stood leaning on the arm of Lord Raby,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
        who had no eyes save for her, and was whispering
        in her ear fond and joyful words while the
        others gathered around Henge. There was
        silence and confusion, however, when my lord
        privy seal entered with Carew.</p>

    <p>“Ah, this is blundering work!” Cromwell
        exclaimed, at the sight of the prostrate figure;
        “this man was needed by the State. Who
        did this?”</p>

    <p>Raby stood forth, and in a moment the light
        of all the torches was centered on his pale face
        and disordered dress.</p>

    <p>“My lord,” he said, “’twas I who disobeyed
        your instructions. When I received the warning,
        sent by one of this villain’s grooms, I ran
        with all speed to the house, and hearing a cry
        for help, came in, the door being unlocked, as
        had been promised. I found this devil here,
        trying to keep this young lady a prisoner.
        We fought and he fell; I knew not that I had
        seriously hurt him.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell was watching the doctor, who had
        his ear against Sir Barton’s breast.</p>

    <p>“Is he gone?” he asked sharply.</p>

    <p>“Nay, my lord,” replied the physician, looking
        up; “he lives, but he is sorely wounded
        and stunned too, by striking his head on the
        table as he fell.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>“Use your skill to save him,” said Cromwell,
        coldly; “the State requires this witness.”
        Then turning to Raby, “My lord, matters
        standing as they do, I pardon you; but never
        try to cheat the headsman, albeit ’tis the
        natural office of a good knight to rescue distressed
        demoiselles, and this fair lady merited
        the service at your hands, having ever been a
        suitor for you, even to the king’s grace. Sir
        William,” he went on, “how came this ending
        to the muddle?”</p>

    <p>“My lord, I caught Raby’s servant, Shaxter,
        early in the evening, and, as you know, my
        Lady Crabtree and I soon found a way to
        make him confess that Henge had bribed
        him to change the packet that I gave to Raby
        for one that Henge had full of treasonable
        matter. Shaxter changed the packets when
        he helped his master to dress, just before he
        was arrested.”</p>

    <p>“Ay, arrested at the complaint of Henge,
        who came to me with every protest of loyalty;
        not that he deceived me,” Cromwell added,
        “but the papers found on Lord Raby did
        mightily confirm his words. I know how you
        brought the villain Shaxter to me when I had
        Raby at my house for private examination; it
        was a happy matter that I could at once release<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
        him, but how came this villain’s schemes to-night
        to miscarry so?”</p>

    <p>“His servants were all false to him,” Sir
        William answered, “and one of them sent us
        warning that he intended to carry off my niece,
        whom he has ever claimed as his affianced wife
        because of an old contract made when she was
        born. I know not yet which varlet of his did
        us this signal service.”</p>

    <p>Cromwell’s keen eyes alighted on Master
        Cross-Eyes, who sat leaning on the table, too
        badly hurt to rise, but overlooked in the tumult.</p>

    <p>“Ah, who is this?” asked the privy seal;
        “how many were in this affray?”</p>

    <p>Betty Carew came forward now and answered
        for her champion.</p>

    <p>“Sir,” she said eagerly, “but for that man
        I should scarcely have escaped so soon. He
        took my part, and fought with Henge in my
        behalf, and from my heart I thank him.”</p>

    <p>“Is it so?” exclaimed Cromwell, glancing
        in some surprise at the unpleasing aspect of
        the man; “what say you, knave, how came you
        to serve this lady?”</p>

    <p>Master Cross-Eyes looked up without any
        change in the sullen expression of his face.</p>

    <p>“The young mistress saved me from the
        hangman when yonder big-nosed woman would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
        have put a halter on my neck,” he retorted
        bluntly, conscious that his night’s work would
        protect him; “and I sent the warning to Sir
        William, despatched my comrades, who hated
        Henge, for he was ever a hard master, full of
        blows and curses and slow to pay, and I stayed
        to protect Mistress Carew.”</p>

    <p>“By Saint Thomas, ’tis the valiant beggar
        that I had scourged at Wildrick!” cried old
        Madam; “may Heaven forgive me for it! You
        shall have a gold piece for every blow and
        more,” she added. “Here, Sir Leech, look to
        his wounds at my cost.”</p>

    <p>“His service has atoned his fault,” Cromwell
        said gravely; “but look you, varlet, being
        strong enough to fight and shrewd enough to
        catch a traitor, if you do not work henceforth,
        you shall hang at Tyburn.”</p>

    <p>“My lord,” interposed Raby, “he will be
        taken into my service for his lifetime, and that
        is not enough to pay the debt.”</p>

    <p>“Ay,” said Carew, “and he is like to make
        a better servant than the knave we have in jail,
        who served you as I foretold. My lord, you
        owe me the wager.”</p>

    <p>“It shall be paid,” Raby answered heartily;
        “yet do I think you never dreamed that he was
        as bad as he has proved.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>“’Tis as I told you,” Sir William retorted
        dryly.</p>

    <p>While this was passing, Cromwell gave
        some brief directions to the captain of the
        watch and his assistants, who were lifting
        Henge’s still unconscious form upon a
        stretcher.</p>

    <p>“To the Tower,” said the king’s minister,
        “and keep him safe; to-morrow he will have to
        answer to the Council if he lives,—he and
        Zachary Sanders.”</p>

    <p>Lord Raby had tenderly placed the mantle
        about Betty’s shoulders and drawn her arm
        through his, for they were all preparing to
        leave the house. Cromwell, turning from his
        talk with the officers, looked at the lovers, and
        a smile lighted up for a moment the stern
        reserve of his strong face.</p>

    <p>“My Lord Raby,” he said quietly, “never,
        I think, had man better cause to bless his fate
        for giving him a faithful heart. This lady hath
        been untiring, brave, and loyal in her suit for
        you. Save for her, the king’s grace would
        scarcely have thought of your cause in this sad
        hour, when the Queen of England lies dead at
        Hampton Court. Fair and faithful Mistress
        Carew,” he added, bowing low over Betty’s
        hand, “I have had to fulfil an unpleasant office;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
        the king’s servant must do his duty even
        though he should break a woman’s heart; but
        never yet have I done mine so heavily as when
        I turned a deaf ear to your suit. I shall take it
        ill if you ask me not to the wedding.”</p>

            <small>THE WIZARD’S FATE</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the trial that followed, the lost threads
        of the great conspiracy were found; and more,
        it was said that the secret examination of
        Henge gave Cromwell the first clue to the
        treason of Exeter and Lady Salisbury, and
        more noble blood flowed on the scaffold. Sir
        Barton suffered a traitor’s death, dying as
        impenitent as he had lived, and cursing his
        fate that Zachary Sanders did not share it.
        And he did not, although the case against him
        was far stronger than against his more violent
        accomplice. The wizard was tried and condemned
        to be hanged, but no halter was placed
        around his neck.</p>

    <p>A strange thing happened. The day set for
        his execution came, and he was led out of the
        Traitors’ Gate into a barge to take him to the
        place where he was to suffer for his treason,
        which had been black enough to hang forty
        men as well as one. He was bound, at least,
        so said the Lieutenant of the Tower, and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
        under strong guard in the king’s boat, yet in
        mid stream he leaped overboard and disappeared.
        His keepers swore that it was magic;
        one smelled sulphur and one swooned with
        horror at a vision he saw in the water. The
        truth of the matter no man ever knew, except
        that six stout yeomen of the Tower suffered for
        the prisoner’s escape, and the wizard was never
        seen alive again. But for years afterwards
        there was a story that he haunted his house
        upon the Thames, and that at night a red light
        shone from every window, and his small figure
        was seen flitting about on the flat roofs of those
        two upper stories. The shadow of the little
        man in the russet cloak haunted every old
        wife’s memory in that neighborhood, and
        whether he lay dead at the bottom of the river,
        or lived in some other region, he was still a
        terror to the imagination of many of his old-time
        clients, and his name hushed many a crying
        child with terror when all else had failed.
        It was even whispered that had he been set
        free, Queen Jane would not have sickened and
        died, and Prince Edward would have been a
        baby of better promise, and not with that look
        which made the old women shake their heads
        in grim foreboding.</p>

    <p>At Christmas of that year, the bells rang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
        merrily at Mohun’s Ottery, and my lord privy
        seal came there to grace the wedding of Lord
        Raby and Mistress Betty Carew; and the
        bride wore on her neck a splendid jewel, sent
        by the king’s grace in memory of her petition
        for her lover. Nor was she portionless,
        although the child of Sir Thomas, for my Lady
        Crabtree gave her a dowry, and it was said
        that in old Madam’s will she was the heiress
        to the vast fortune that had accumulated and
        doubled under Lady Crabtree’s shrewd management.
        Sir William Carew gave away the
        bride, who looked the great beauty that she
        was in her white robes and with the light of
        love and happiness, which is a wondrous beautifier,
        in her brown eyes. It was said that
        there had never been a more stately or handsome
        couple wedded in Devon, or a finer wedding;
        though some stared at the groom’s
        strange servant, for Master Cross-Eyes, even
        in his wedding garments, looked a rough
        attendant; but to Lady Raby he seemed an
        angel in disguise.</p>

    <p>Standing beside her husband, Betty looked
        about the great hall thronged with guests in
        her honor, and in her heart she remembered
        the sad and penniless orphan who had come
        there a few years before. In her happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
        she did not forget her thanksgiving to Heaven
        for the wonderful change which had come into
        her life, which, stretching out before her in a
        golden vista, seemed to hold only love and
        hope.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>The scene of this thrilling story is Moscow, and the
            time, the boyhood of Peter the Great. Much of the action
            takes place “On The Red Staircase” in the palace of the
            Kremlin.</p>

        <div class="blockquot2">
            <p>It is a thrilling tale of intrigue and barbaric plot. A French viscount
                visiting Moscow on a diplomatic service is the hero; and his adventures
                while trying to rescue the beautiful Zenaide from a cruel uncle, who is
                bent upon marrying her to a profligate, are constant and of an intense
                order of interest.... The scenes are exciting. Escapes follow escapes.
                Secret missions with packets (stolen by hidden pursuers) are incidents of
                the plot; while sword-cuts, pinionings, attacks of all kinds, kidnapping,
                and desperate acts fill the pages.... The book is exciting, well sustained
                and excellently written.... Another “Zenda” story.—<i>Chicago Times-Herald.</i></p>

            <p>A most vivid and absorbing tale of love and adventure.... Miss
                Taylor has certainly an unusual gift of vivid word painting; and as we
                read, we can almost see the savage mob, and feel ourselves to be in danger.
                “On the Red Staircase” will give a far truer, because more striking
                and life-like, picture of early Russian history than a multitude of
                laboriously written and ponderous histories of the time, and the authoress
                has apparently a most promising future before her.—<i>The Churchman,
                    New York.</i></p>

            <p>After the many problem-novels and the myriad psychological disquisitions
                disguised as fiction, a wholesome, breezy tale like this, honestly
                and brilliantly told for its own sake, is a real treat to be enjoyed without
                thought or criticism.—<i>The Bookman, New York.</i></p>

            <p>A strong, bracing story it is, and one which gives us a clear view of
                an exceptionally interesting epoch in Russian history.—<i>New York

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>Miss M. Imlay Taylor will be remembered as the author
            of a spirited Russian historical novel called “On the Red
            Staircase,” which has attained a wide reading the past year.
            She has now written a second novel of the same general description,
            called “An Imperial Lover.” Again the scene is
            the Russian court, this time in the reign of Peter the Great,
            who plays a very important part in the plot. The tale is one
            of love, of intrigue, and of adventure, and seems to us even
            better than its predecessor.—<i>The Outlook</i>, New York.</p>

        <p>The setting is admirably adapted to development under
            a skillful hand, and the author has succeeded in this undertaking.—<i>The
                Washington Star.</i></p>

        <p>M. Imlay Taylor has the story-teller’s gift in perfection.
            Every word of her new Russian romance, “An Imperial
            Lover,” is as captivating as was every word of “On the Red
            Staircase.”—<i>The Times-Herald</i>, Chicago.</p>

        <p>The story abounds in exciting incidents and has no dull
            pages.—<i>The Inter-Ocean</i>, Chicago.</p>

        <p>M. Imlay Taylor gives us a picturesque and interesting
            sketch of Moscow society during an eminently interesting
            period, and tells a capital story.—<i>The Scotsman</i>, Edinburgh.</p>

        <p>The novel not only shows careful and intelligent study of
            the period, but it is skilfully constructed, well written, and
            thoroughly interesting.—<i>The Spectator</i>, London.</p>

            historical romance.—<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, London, Eng.</p>

        <p>It is a far cry from Russia to the United States, yet Mary
            Imlay Taylor, who has written some most interesting stories
            of intrigue and fighting at St. Petersburg, shows in her latest
            romance, “A Yankee Volunteer,” that she is quite as much
            at home in America as in the Czar’s country. Her new book
            has for historic background the events of the first half of the
            Revolutionary War, and it tells a love story which is charming
            and quite a part of the stern adventures that make a hero.—<i>Evening
                Bulletin</i>, Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>It is a good story—this of the Yankee rebel—“so gallant

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>The uncommonly favorable reception of Mrs. Abbott’s brilliant
            novelette, “Alexia,” by the public bespeaks in advance a lively
            interest in her new novel, “The Beverleys.” It is a more extended
            and ambitious work than the former, but has the same grace of style
            and liveliness of treatment, together with a much more considerable
            plot and more subtle delineations of character and life. The action
            of the story takes place in India, and reveals on the part of the
            authoress the most intimate knowledge of the official life of the
            large and aristocratic English colony in Calcutta. The local coloring
            is strong and unusual.</p>

        <p>A more joyous story cannot be imagined.... A harum-scarum
            good-nature; a frank pursuit of cakes and ale; a heedless, happy-go-lucky
            spirit, are admirable components in a novel, however trying
            they may be found in the walks of daily life. Such are the pleasures
            of “The Beverleys.” To read it is recreation, indeed.—<i>Public
                Ledger, Philadelphia.</i></p>

        <p>The author writes throughout with good taste, and with a quick
            eye for the picturesque.—<i>Herald, New York.</i></p>

        <p>It is a pretty story, charmingly written, with cleverly sketched
            pictures of various types of character.... The book abounds in
            keen, incisive philosophy, wrapped up in characteristic remarks.—<i>Times,
                Chicago.</i></p>

        <p>An absorbing story. It is brilliantly and vivaciously written.—<i>Literary
                World, Boston.</i></p>

        <p>The author has until now been known, so far as we are aware,
            only by her former story, “Alexia.” Unless signs fail which seldom
            <i>do</i> fail, these two with which her name is now associated are
            simply the forerunners of works in a like vein of which American
            literature will have reason to be proud.—<i>Standard, Chicago.</i>

        </div>

        <div>
            1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
            electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
            and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
            (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
            the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
            destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
            possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
            Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
            by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
            or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

        <div>
            1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
            used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
            agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
            things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
            even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
            paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
            agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

            1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
            Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
            of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
            works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
            States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
            United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
            claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
            displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
            all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
            that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
            free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
            works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
            Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
            comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
            same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
            you share it without charge with others.
        </div>


        <div>
            1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
            what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
            in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
            check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
            agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
            distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
            other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

        <div>
            1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
            derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
            contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
            copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

        </div>

        <div>
            1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
            with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
            must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
            additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
            will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works

            other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
            version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
            (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

            of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
            Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the

            provided that:
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
                the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
                you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
                to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
                agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
                within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
                legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
                payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
                Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
                Literary Archive Foundation.”
            </li>

            <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
                you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
                does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
                License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
                copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
                all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
                works.
            </li>

            <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
                any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
                electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
                receipt of the work.
            </li>

            <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
                distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
            are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
            from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
            the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
            forth in Section 3 below.

            1.F.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
            effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
            works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
            Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
            contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
            or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
            intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
            other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
            cannot be read by your equipment.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
            of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
            Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
            liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
            fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
            LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
            PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
            TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
            LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
            INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGE.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
            defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
            receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
            written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
            received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
            with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
            with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
            lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
            or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
            opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
            the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
            without further opportunities to fix the problem.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
            in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
            OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
            LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
            warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
            damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
            violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
            agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
            limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
            unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
            remaining provisions.
        </div>

        <div>
            1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
            trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
            providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
            accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
            production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
            including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
            the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
            or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
            additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
            Defect you cause.

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
            electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
            computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
            exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
            from people in all walks of life.
        </div>

        <div>
            Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
            goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
            remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
            and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
            generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

        </div>

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
            public support and donations to carry out its mission of
            increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
            freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
            array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
            ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
            status with the IRS.
        </div>

        <div>
            The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
            where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

            International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

        </div>

        <div>
            Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
            Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
            freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
            volunteer support.
        </div>

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
            editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
            the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
            necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
            edition.
